"1",1,589736,"Aries","   Much funny.  2 points.  As mentioned in the email, no game this week; I have to research a 13th century poem for a final paper.  I enjoy the work, but I'd much rather have swashbuckling adventure in wintery Hillsfar. "
"2",2,589736,"Aries","   Harpers, Harpers, everywhere.  Harpers, Harpers, they really care. Harpers, Harpers, stay in motion.  Harpers, Harpers, healing potions. Harpers, Harpers, pins of green.  Harpers, Harpers, enter the scene. Harpers, Harpers, formed by a bard.  Harpers, Harpers, .... What?  A Bard?!?!  You got to be fucking kidding me, right?!?!  A Bard?!  Jesus Christ, we're screwed!! "
"3",3,589736,"Aries","   In an earlier post, Johnathan said:   'And then: What of Gregory? Does he feel a pull to move beyond his comfort zone, or is it a natural evolution for him to remain in the Central Heartlands of Faerun, patrolling the darkness that lurks therein? ........ There is room for everyone, and for every player in the saga, Glory Awaits. But what Glory will that be? The Local Hero? The Regional Hero? The Hero of the Land? The Hero of a World? Or the Hero of the Multiverse?'   To respond to this in a way, I would say that Gregory is really having to make a sort of leap of faith to swallow all of this extraplanar stuff.  He gets it and doesn't get it at the same time.  He can understand the world as being a large and changing place, but seeing Father Castillion in the Ethereal plane...well, freaked him out.  To Gregory, it was basically like talking to a ghost, and that is just creepy.  He understands gods, but for there to be something bigger than gods that can take a whole planet and put it in the middle of a nothingness place, it's just a bit much.  Even though he is actually experiencing it, he is still kind of thinking in the back of his mind, 'Yeah....right....whatever you say man.'  And what glory will he find?  Local Hero?  Multiverse?  He would most likely never expect to rise above something between Hero of the Land and Hero of the World.  Frankly, because he doesn't really see/understand the whole multiverse thing, and even being 'Hero of the World' is kind of pretentious in his eyes.  "
"4",4,589736,"Aries","    I'd post this on the RTG Blog, but I can't post there. Could someone either post or e-mail me the resolution to the Catillian situation? As the original hook of our adventure, I'm kind of curious. Thanks.  # posted by IDIC : 10/23/2003 12:53:31 PM     Castillion  was rescued during the collapse by unnamed friends, and is now alive and well in the Ethereal. The party talked with him in the office of Din Dal Kut, who resides on a splinter plane. It seems that when Thulos took Terranel, the 'local group' of the multiverse was torn away with it, and all exist as a miniature multiverse in the in-between-place.   A side result of this occurence is that, according to Castillion, the dead have nowhere to go, and have been gathering at an unknown city for millenia. Castillion is now dedicated to renewing contact with the gods, if possible. He has recommened that the party join forces with the Harpers, a secret society formed by the last Elven bard at the very end of the Great Retreat.   Upon seeing Calleum and the banner of Heironeous in a magical viewing painting/frame on Din Dal Kut's office wall, Burne leapt to join his mentor, and was last seen in a battle in Rashemen, one of the lands that borders the Far East. The act broke the portal, and the party was unable to follow.   Also, Castillon is Ian's father.   Having reached the end of the original journey, Ian and Gregory are beginning to question if they should continue, or return to Tilverton to tell of Castillion's demise -- which was Castillion's request, as the truth would be too difficult to understand.  Players have the option of sending their character off to do something long-term, and create and play a new character. The world stage has expanded wide enough to accomodate such. Once the false murder rap is resolved, the party may see the Breaking of the original Fellowship -- but the beginning of a much larger, world-spanning epic.   # posted by Harmony : 10/23/2003 02:00:31 PM   "
"5",5,589736,"Aries","   The answer to the first question lies with Master Po; the answer to the second is Sister Jayna, the priestess who took over after Castillion departed. "
"6",6,589736,"Aries","   it seems odd to think of brother ian as having a father.  he seems like the type that just sprouted out of the ground. and if fc really is his father, then why didn't he claim him earlier?  who is his mother?   "
"7",7,589736,"Aries","   since our next game is the weekend of halloween, why don't we all dress up like our characters next session? "
"8",8,589736,"Aries","   - Hillsfar, ruled by Lord Malthiir, believed by the party to be a former gang/crime lord, who came to power by unknown means.  - The Red Plumes, an army of mercenaries recently added to a pre-existing smaller force; news its victory over the most recent orc attack (of which there have been three so far in the region) is spreading, attracting more enlistees.  - The local Thieves' Guild, a member of which helped acquire the antidote for Ian and Rhanellus  - The Hand, a mysterious order of deadly monks and assassins  - K'Sh'Aal, a powerful unidentified figure who apparently pulls many strings; according to Luc, the name is reminiscent of those used by dragons - The Zhentarim, an order of sorcerers who actively seek power; rumor suggests that they are on the verge of an internal struggle  - The Harpers, a centuries-old secret society that seeks a way to restore Faerun  - Jalal, the Elven-designated watcher/keeper of Cormanthor  - Garovia, a recently-awakened corrupted Druid, whereabouts unknown  - Orcs, thousands of which live north of the Moonsea; the attack on Hillsfar is the third such action in the past year  - The Citadel of the Raven, a tower complex where resides Lividia, who has been linked to Rhanellus, the sacking of Shadowdale, keech (an addictive plant), the recent orc invasion, possible agents within the Red Plumes, and the foreign goblin machinists  - Lizard Folk, of which nothing is known except they attacked the party during the interrogation of a keech-addicted Red Plume guard   Plus various individual contacts the party has met or heard of.

"9",9,589736,"Aries","   It's okay, rock lobster.  All is well.  If email is iffy, we can always use this handy blog.  I will make an effort to deliver announcements both here and by email. "
"10",10,589736,"Aries","   perhaps we can have it that if an email is sent out that a confirmation email can be sent back.  i don't know why it didn't go through or why no one received it.  the only way ben knew what he did is because i spoke to him on thursday.   i'm going to stop using the netscape account though - if everyone could change my email to madduxmir@yahoo.com, i would appreciate it. sorry again  "
"11",11,589736,"Aries","   Mir -- Ben said something about 50/50.  Regardless, we missed you; hope your day was a good one.  Father Castillion has been found, and the end of the battle of Hillsfar was remembered, in which everyone earned an average of 2,000 xp, and a few leveled.  Also, Scott got some much needed rest. "
"12",12,589736,"Aries","   I don't know how long RTG will last. I don't see a reason to end it, as I am presently committed to gaming as a regular activity in my life. Players may come and go, but I will be writing and running some sort of game as long as people want to participate in such.  # posted by Harmony : 10/15/2003 03:31:00 PM   so does that mean rtg will last until 2005?  # posted by hotcocoa : 10/15/2003 02:56:13 PM   At my current pace, I will graduate in either Dec '05 or May '06.

"13",13,589736,"Aries","   and as far as characters go, i like luc - i want to see where her story goes - i've committed over 2 years to seeing how she would develop and i want to see the ending.  i feel like i owe it to her.   "
"14",14,589736,"Aries","   and i don't even believe that duellacathata is actually dead.  i can't believe that powerful of a magic user wouldn't have a backup plan in case her body was destroyed. "
"15",15,589736,"Aries","   To be fair, Duellacathata didn't directly frame the party; that was (supposedly) the desire of K'Sh'Aal (or, rather, his/her/its representative).  Duellacathata just wanted Falchez dead and buried in his family's magically sealed tomb.  Or so she claimed.  Ashes, of course, tell no tales. "
"16",16,589736,"Aries","   i'm going to stick with Ian, for now.  but having the choice is quite cool.   welcome, scott!  glad you were able to get in this time.  let me know if you have any further trouble.  any chance we could just teleport to the dragon's graveyard, and then teleport back?  'cause *damn* it's a long way back south, in the opposite direction of everything else we want to see, even by way of the cave network previously mentioned...  after we find out about castillian, i say we:  - clear our names, expose the conspiracy, report the lizard men sighting - determine burne's fate - go destroy the keech fields and, maybe, lividia - find a big enough city where we can all train and otherwise increase our skills  not necessarily in that order, but close enough.  was the Hand mentioned as possibly being involved in our current predicament, in regards to the murder we've been accused of?  can't *believe* that Zhenterem bitch killed that banker and framed us for the murder,  just so she could raise him from the dead to steal from his own deceased grandmother.  way to go, rhanellus!  burn baby burn...   "
"17",17,589736,"Aries","   Once the party discovers what happened to Castillion (a mystery that technically matters directly to only two present characters -- Gregory and Ian), the group will be at an interesting crux:  What Next?  The party is now international in membership, and global (and beyond) in awareness of The World.  The mysteries and challenges that have been placed on the table are definitely different from how the story began.  This may be frustrating to some, and I understand the desire for simplicity (Let's Just Get The Ring to Mount Doom), but it was always my intention to create a broad, organic world within which various characters could pursue adventure and glory.  I had done the Single Through-Line campaign before; I was interested in trying something with fewer (if any) boundaries.  The catch, though, is that the game began with certain set archetypes, if you will -- various Local Yokels and a couple of Wild Cards who set out to figure something out -- and those archetypes may, very reasonably, strain a bit at the edges as they move beyond the comfort zone of what they originally intended and expected to do.  Which is kind of my point -- what do the players feel about their characters' comfort zones?  Of the current party, Fennie and Connor are the most likely to pursue adventure for its own sake.  Rhanellus has a personal journey to take that seems, at the moment, to be connected to the Big Picture in some unknown way.  Adan has a spiritual calling to Right What Has Been Changed, and it is natural for him to roam the world on that quest.  Luc, like Rhanellus, has a personal journey that seems linked somehow to the events of the world -- specifically, the often-mentioned return of the Demon Kings.  But then, there are other issues:  Connor would probably like to find the other two thirds of the Codex one day; Fennie would like to put this map to the Dragon's Graveyard to use before she dies; Luc would like to know who made her a 'key,' and can it be undone; and Rhanellus wants to go wherever clues lead him to his own self-knowledge.  Each of these goals is, unlike the World In Crisis situation, not only individual and unique, but geographically diverse -- to the point:  Candlekeep, the Citadel of the Raven, the mountains on the other side of the Dalelands, Cormyr, Zhentil Keep, and the distant land of Thay.  Talk about an Indiana Jones red line map crawl.  And then:  What of Gregory?  Does he feel a pull to move beyond his comfort zone, or is it a natural evolution for him to remain in the Central Heartlands of Faerun, patrolling the darkness that lurks therein?  Likewise, what of Ian?  Should he return to the monastery and report what he has learned, or is he a free agent?  I'm not declaring anything here -- just sharing some observations from this side of the screen.  What we have now is the result of something I have personally always wanted to do, but never tried -- a game world that spans centuries, nations, and even continents and oceans.  There is room for everyone, and for every player in the saga, Glory Awaits.  But what Glory will that be?  The Local Hero?  The Regional Hero?  The Hero of the Land?  The Hero of a World?  Or the Hero of the Multiverse?  Certainly questions worth thinking about.  As I mentioned in the previous post, all characters are welcome to follow their path to Glory from the point where they started.  Likewise, players are free to create new heroes should their characters evolve onto a path unique to themselves.  Unless a character dies, everyone who has been in the world will still be an active and prominent participant in the world, even if they are not represented in a game session.  Boris Borovich and Burne Trinson are out there even now, making choices that matter.  The same could be said of any character that chose to veer off on his or her own.  Personally, I like all the characters.  I enjoy their choices and their actions, both their desires and the things they don't really give a flying fig about.  All are welcome to do as they please, as they follow their own Road to Glory.  "
"18",18,589736,"Aries","   Referring to Johnathan's post, I think that the party clearly does not have the same goals.  This is fine, mind you, but needs pointing out none the less.  Personally, I just don't feel that Gregory has evolved enough within himself to be able to broaden the lens/scope for him.  He is still very much following his own set of goals.  Some of which are shared by other party members, such as finding Castillion, but like the majority of the party, he seems to have his own agenda.   "
"19",19,589736,"Aries","   [ Mon Oct 06, 05:44:17 PM | hot chocolate ]  oh burne, how i miss thee and thine control over ye big mouthed monk.   [ Mon Oct 06, 04:19:35 PM | Harmony Baggins ]  ...and so it was that Burne lived out his years, with wife and kids, in the land of Chesterfieldius.   In case you're curious: after pursuing various leads regarding both their recent memory loss and the murder they are suspected of committing, the party has made a curious and partially unexplained bargain with several Illithids, who promise to restore their memories -- an act which may resolve several questions, one of which being the location and activities of the missing Burne.

Good journey.  "
"20",20,589736,"Aries","   To paraphrase JMS of B5 fame, one might consider this the story of a platoon in WWII.  Whatever happens to the platoon, the story of WWII goes on, often dwarfing the individual soldier.  Perhaps the best one can hope for is to be present at Midway, or help raise the flag on Iwo Jima, or be the bombadier on the Enola Gay.  Regardless, there are two valid choices:  either to focus only on one's own mission and interests, or to expand that focus to include the scope and detail of the war in part or in its entirety.  What the player finds entertaining, rewarding, and manageable is often defined by what he or she chooses to be specifically relevant to the character.  Of course, in a party of seven characters, there are seven separate lists of what is relevant.  If one is to remain with a party and not go off on one's own -- which would be perfectly acceptable, except that it would result in leaving the game -- there is an argument to be made for being aware of what the other six individuals deem relevant to them.  Otherwise, one is watching choices without clear motivation, and the result can be a frustrating chaos.  Thus, the list of what one needs to know to function within the story grows a little bit longer.  And so on.  By the way, as a general note:  If any player starts to feel that his or her character *would*, at some point, decide that it's more logical to leave the party and pursue his or her own agenda, it is perfectly acceptable for the player to create another character that will join the party and take the previous character's place.  There's no rule that says you must stay with one character throughout.  Once provided with the player's basic guidelines/requests, I would NPC the character Somewhere Out In The World until such a time that the player wanted that character to return.  Alternately, the path of the absent character might later intersect with the party again, and for a time the player could play both until one left again (hopefully this would only be a session or two.)  Anway -- just a random thing to toss out there.  Even though it began as a simple mystery of What Happened to Father Castillion, the camera has pulled back far enough now that almost all the world is in play.  Thus my interest in launching some side games that occur elsewhere in the world's history.  This post, like many stories, seems to have grown with the telling.  I'll stop now.  "

"85",85,589736,"Aries","           I am going off of other people's words here, but, supposedly, the Ep II novel discusses spirits (for lack of a better word).  When Anakin has sanpped and is slaughtering the Tuskins, they pan back to Yoda and you here Qui-Gon say 'Anakin! Anakin! NO!!!!'  In the book, Yoda and Windu are puzzled by this, because there has aparently never been an reports of an afterlife or whatever you want to call it.  Taking that, you could assume that Yoda and Obi-Wan figured out how to live on.  Remember, Obi-Wan warns Vader that he will become more powerful than can be imagined.  Now, it does not explain Vader.  Mir - Obi-Wan did not communicate with Luke immediately upon his death, possibly explaining why Yoda did not.  As for sensing Leia, that's easy.

"
"88",88,589736,"Aries","           something else that hasn't been specifically addressed yet: 'disappearing' vs. 'leaving a corpse' at the death of a jedi.  in e4, obi-wan 'dies' at vader's saber, but leaves no body behind - an event which seems to puzzle vader.  in e6, yoda dies by visibly fading away in front of luke.  also in e6, vader dies, but his body remains.  same for qui-gon in e1, and some unknown jedi in e2 (in the arena scene).   so what's up with that?  you can't argue that only jedi masters get to fade away when they buy it - qui-gon was a master.  there's an argument to be made regarding whether a jedi has the time to anticipate his or her own death; yoda and obi-wan both knew it was immanent, and if there's some 'thing' one needs to do to not leave a body behind, perhaps it requires at least a few moments to prepare.  obi-wan turned off his saber and closed his eyes; yoda relaxed and closed his eyes.  some sort of meditative state is suggested by these moments.    qui-gon did medidate in the middle of his fight with darth maul, but he apparently felt optimistic enough about the outcome of the battle that he didn't bother to memorize the 'body fade away at death' spell.  ;)  however, he stayed alive long enough to have some final words with obi-wan - so why wasn't he able to utilize that period of time to initiate his 'disappearence'?  unless it requires that you prepare yourself   before   a fatal blow, this explanation isn't consistent.  and then there's vader/annakin.  supposedly, and by his own admission, luke 'saved' him from the dark side before he died.  he even appears as a 'ghost' next to obi-wan and yoda at the end of e6 - which suggests that all 3 of them went to the same 'place' after death.  so why does vader leave a body behind?  i've heard some fans argue that perhaps his body faded away 'off camera', and that luke was only burning vader's armor in the funeral pyre.  i don't buy this, though.    heck, maybe the 'disappearing death' is some new trick that the jedi learn between e2 and e4!  after all, sometime during this same period, the whole branch of thought concerning 'midichlorians' gets dumped...  thoughts?  i know this is an obscure one, and it may come down to an inconsistency that in hindsight, lucas said, 'oh crap, that's right.  oh well.'          "
"89",89,589736,"Aries","           the circle of irony welcomes our two latest members: shannon erwin and johnathan 'better-late-than-never' shipley.  ;)  please see the prior notes about proper 'blogging' contained in prior posts - they're in the archive section now, but they're a good reference should you have any questions.    episode 3 news:  apparently there will be 'several' years between e2 and e3, and then 'about 20' years between e3 and e4.  luke and leia will appear as 'infants' in e3 (towards or at the end).  my rant:  i'm getting tired of CGI being used to create human or human-like creatures.  landscapes are OK, but CGI creatures are still just fancy cartoon characters.  until they're indistinguishable from 'actual' creatures, i can't take them seriously; i.e., they serve only as a clever but distracting talking head in what might be an otherwise serious scene.  if you're making a comedy and/or kids film (which may be all lucas is trying to do now), then perhaps this perspective is overly critical; but admittedly, i took the original trilogy to be a story somewhere between modern mythology and serious science fiction.  these films are something else; something modern, but not as deep, somehow.  thankfully, i didn't have to endure watching a cartoon lizard/rabbit thing step in feces this time, but i did get weary of the 'C-3PO has switched heads with another robot' gag.  yes, it was funny in the first scene where this occurs.  however, it ceases being funny by the fifth time that we're reminded, 'look!  C-3PO has switched heads with another robot!  hilarious, huh?'  by that point, i'm cringing, hoping it will stop, and that we'll get on with that 'other' plot thread of watching the jedi council beng attacked by the forces of Darth Tyrannus.  we can't say we weren't warned, though, even before episode one; namely, with the ewoks, in episode six... but even that was tolerable, given that things were on the upswing - it's (sort of) a pleasant thing to see the furry warriors triumph over the evil empire.  by that point, we feel the immense scale of the overall conflict - a galactic conflict between good and evil, spanning hundreds of worlds, coming together in a final battle.  the ewoks aren't distracting in e6 because they seem like a small part of a much larger tapestry.    in e1 and e2, however, the sight gags and the bad puns seem to be given the same weight as the rest of the events in the story.  the ewoks were just a little something for the kids in e6, and a way to symbolize the hope of a happier future for the galaxy; they're not important to the great arc of things, and the screen time that they are given is balanced with the bigger events accordingly.  heck, a couple of the ewoks are even shown dying in the battle; but lucas wouldn't have dared showing any gungans getting creamed - he's too afraid of scaring the kids now.  he was a little bolder in e2, with the assination attempt at the beginning, but it's easy to kill off characters that we met, oh, 2 seconds before they blew up.   ok, 8 seconds if you count the screen time padme's stand-in had in e1 - but you see my point.    when qui-gon dies at the end of e1, it's unfortunate.  when obi-wan 'dies' at the end of e4, it's a tragedy.  why?  probably something to do with acting, character development, etc.  but more than that - in e4, obi-wan and the rest of the gang never had to compete with cartoon characters (and background sets) for screen time.  like you said, JLS - pretty pictures.  a new trilogy for a different crowd; lighter, goofier, and in the end, a kid's movie.  and once i accept this, i find i can enjoy the whole experience with a much less critical, cynical eye.  after all, how serious can i be (or be taken), posing for pictures in a jedi outfit for total strangers?  ;)          "

"92",92,589736,"Aries","           the whole thing was a dupe, engineered by palpatine/sideous to take control of the republic, with a now tried-and-true army to back up said control.  jango was working for dooku/tyrannus, dooku/tyrannus was working for palpatine/sideous.  dooku had orders to let the whole thing unfold roughly the way it did - give the republic an enemy to fight, and then step in to fight it, proving to your constituents that they need you to protect them.  classic empire building - divide and conquer, from within.  i had indeed thought of the seperatist / rebellion connection - i think they're one and the same.  anyone in the republic who had any sympathy for the seperatists will have to accept the fact that they almost wiped out the jedi council under dooku's direction.  many will side with palpatine as a result, and support his use of the clone army to make them pay for what they did.  the separatists will slowly become the rebellion that we're familiar with in episode 4 as the roots of the deception become clear.  for now, dooku will continue to serve as the lead 'boogey man' for the jedi and republican troops to focus on, while the real threat slowly arises behind them, as palpatine gains political power.  eventually, dooku will be exposed and/or killed, leaving the seperatists in chaos.  meanwhile, the peaceful republic will continue to transform into the empire, as the noble jedi knights are swept away to make room for the soulless cloned soldiers.  episode 3 should be quite the laugh riot.

On the other, he appeared to be working for Dooku to assassinate Amidala.  But Dooku was building the droid army that the clones fought.  Was he just playing for both sides?  2)  Who was/is Sipha Dious?  My spelling is made up, and this question is not my own, but if you take out the 'pha', what do you have left?  Sidious.  Coincidence?  3)  Why was Palpatine/Sidious creating two armies that were destined to fight each other?  Did anyone think about the fact that the Seperatists may actually be the beginning seeds of the Rebellion?  If so, how ironic is it that the future rebellion was responsible for the death of so many Jedi?  All in all it was an ok movie, but I find myself agreeing with Johnnathan on a movie for a change.

'What does it mean in the long run that we have females who are significantly more literate, significantly more educated than their male counterparts? It is likely to create a lot of social problems. This does not bode well for anyone.' and 'As a nation, we simply can't afford to have half of our population not developing the skill sets that we are going to need to go into the future,' said Susan L.

"129",129,589736,"Aries","           32, huh?  Youngster  ;)  Why don't I support Kyoto?  A)  I still not accept that there is global warming.  We have hard data going back about 100 years.  Before that, the information is pieced together from journal entries and assumptions of temperatures and oxygen levels taken from ice cores.  100 years - longer than the average lifespan - is not even a tick on the cosmic clock.  The Earth has seen at least one ice age that we know of.  Climate changes in cycles.  How do we know that  if  there is indeed global warming that we are the cause.  We do not have enough data to state that with any kind of scientific certainty.  (I define a scientific certainty as something that happens almost all the time - like gravity; hold an object over the edge a building and let go.  99.9999999999999% of the time it will fall down) B)  Let's assume that there is global warming.  The first time I recall that term being used, I was in 9th or 10th grade.  At that point, the experts said that if we did not do anything, that the polar ice caps would melt within 20 years and that the oceans would rise 100 feet.  You know what?  That was 17-18 years ago.  The last I knew, the Outer Banks are still there.  Manhattan is still there.  My point is, the have been predicting the apocolypse for nearly 20 years and it has not happened.  Again, assuming that global warming is real.  What effects will that have, and what will nature do to counter it?  If carbon dioxide is the real culprit here, then nature already has a built in ability to fight it - plants and photosynthesis.  An oft forgotten fact from your 10th grade biology class is that plants do indeed breath oxygen (as does any living organism).  Of course, plants also absorb CO2 and light and convert that to glucose (I think) and oxygen.  They release more oxygen than they use.  If the temperatures get warmer, the growing season for plants will increase, allowing them more time to do their thing (not to mention increase food production).  'But John, we are cutting down forests and paving over farmland!'.  That is so, but that is not what Kyoto addresses.  I am for slower, more controled growth, with more green space requirements. C)  I am an American.  I like the culture and freedom we have.  I like the prosperity of the country.  Kyoto would severly damage that.  By making us reduce our CO2 levels to below what they were 10 years ago, our economy would be wrecked.  Yes, there may be an increase in some sectors (those that make the expensive new 'green' technology), but not enough to counter the industries that get destroyed by it (cars and manufacturing).  Kyoto does not equitably place a burden on all countries.  The US is by far the hardest hit by Kyoto's requirements. Who do you think runs the dirtiest power plants?  The US with the EPA hawking ever molecule that comes out of a smokestck or some developing country with no environmental controls at all?  Yet, who is forced to make the biggest changes? D)  Again, assuming that there is global warming.  I have not ever heard anyone discuss what effect the 6 billion humans have on this.  We have to be putting out an awful lot of CO2.  We have more than doubled the population of the Earth in the last 100 years.  That has to have some direct effect as well as many secondary (like more need for resources and manufactured products) E)  Because global warming would allow me to play golf all year long.         "

"133",133,589736,"Aries","           Mir - I have no idea how old you are, but I think we are all seeing the effects of disatisfaction with our current lots in life.  I don't know if it falls under the category of 'mid-life crisis', but it seems to be similar.  To all those listed below, these are just my observations and are in no way intended to be judgemental.  Me - Established in my career (11 years now); Secure in my position and qualifications within my company; Am tired of doing what I am doing and looking for a possible change into computer programming Mir - Not happy with her current lot in life and seeking a change, though aparently unsure of what the change should be. Johnnathan - Working to get by and meet his next goal of an advanced degree in literature; no desire to stay in his current career Scott - Looking at a change to Real Estate; burned out on IT Jimi - Going to school after his immediate post high school education plans fell through Ben - After years of seemingly aimless work, entered the 'mainstream' workforce  So, of us 6 in RTG (with the exception of Neal, whom I have not known long enough to observe such details), 5 of us are actively or at least considering career changes.  I think that maybe we have been seduced by the American dream where anybody can be sucessful if they find something they truely love.  I could stay where I am now and provide for my familys needs for the next 30 years,  But, will I be happy?  Probably not.  Is this a local phenomenon or a cultural event?

"134",134,589736,"Aries","           Aparently, and I have no text to back this up, the report sent to the UN came from the EPA and not the White House - small but significant difference.  President Bush has reaffirmed his opposition to Kyoto (phew).  I am a little concerned that some lower level government official (Christine Todd Whitman at the highest) has the authority to send such a report, supposedly representing the view of the President, to the UN when the report does not agree with his opinion / policy.

"137",137,589736,"Aries","           Mir, you must be slipping.

On the morning of July 23, 1999, law enforcement officers fanned out and arrested more than 10 percent of Tulia's tiny African-American population. Also arrested were a handful of whites who had relationships with blacks. The humiliating roundup was intensely covered by the local media, which had been tipped off in advance. Men and women, bewildered and unkempt, were paraded before TV cameras and featured prominently on the evening news. They were drug traffickers, one and all, said the sheriff, a not particularly bright Tulia bulb named Larry Stewart. Among the 46 so-called traffickers were a pig farmer, a forklift operator and a number of ordinary young women with children. If these were major cocaine dealers, as alleged, they were among the oddest in the U.S. None of them had any money to speak of. And when they were arrested, they didn't have any cocaine. No drugs, money or weapons were recovered during the surprise roundup. Most of Tulia's white residents applauded the arrests, and the local newspapers were all but giddy with their editorial approval. The first convictions came quickly, and the sentences left the town's black residents aghast. One of the few white defendants, a man who happened to have a mixed-race child, was sentenced to more than 300 years in prison. The hog farmer, a black man in his late 50's named Joe Moore, was sentenced to 90 years. Kareem White, a 24-year-old black man, was sentenced to 60 years. And so on. When the defendants awaiting trial saw this extreme sentencing trend, they began scrambling to plead guilty in exchange for lighter sentences. These ranged from 18 years in prison to, in some case, just probation. It is not an overstatement to describe the arrests in Tulia as an atrocity. The entire operation was the work of a single police officer who claimed to have conducted an 18-month undercover operation. The arrests were made solely on the word of this officer, Tom Coleman, a white man with a wretched work history, who routinely referred to black people as 'niggers' and who frequently found himself in trouble with the law. Mr. Coleman's alleged undercover operation was ridiculous. There were no other police officers to corroborate his activities. He did not wear a wire or conduct any video surveillance. And he did not keep detailed records of his alleged drug buys. He said he sometimes wrote such important information as the names of suspects and the dates of transactions on his leg. In trial after trial, prosecutors put Mr. Coleman on the witness stand and his uncorroborated, unsubstantiated testimony was enough to send people to prison for decades. In some instances, lawyers have been able to show that there was no basis in fact  none at all  for Mr. Coleman's allegations, that they came from some realm other than reality. He said, for example, that he had purchased drugs from a woman named Tonya White, and she was duly charged. But last April the charges had to be dropped when Ms. White's lawyers proved that she had cashed a check in Oklahoma City at the time that she was supposed to have been selling drugs to Mr. Coleman in Tulia. Another defendant, Billy Don Wafer, was able to prove  through employee time sheets and his boss's testimony  that he was working at the time he was alleged by Mr. Coleman to have been selling cocaine. And the local district attorney, Terry McEachern, had to dismiss the case against a man named Yul Bryant after it was learned that Mr. Coleman had described him as a tall black man with bushy hair. Mr. Bryant was 5-foot-6 and bald. In a just world, this case would be no more than a spoof on 'Saturday Night Live.' Instead it's a tragedy with no remedy in sight. The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the William Moses Kunstler Fund for Racial Justice, the Tulia Legal Defense Project and a number of private law firms are trying to mount an effort to free the men and women imprisoned in this fiasco. The idea that people could be rounded up and sent away for what are effectively lifetime terms solely on the word of a police officer like Tom Coleman is insane.             "

"167",167,589736,"Aries","           I was over my brother's house changing the oil in my car. I learned that Nissan to use a small size oil filter that my brother's oil clamp would not grip. They also like to hide the oil filter in a place where there no grip. It is amazing how tight the filter gets. I was pounding on it to loosen it to no avail. Finally my I asked my brother for a large grip wrench. He had none. Though he came up with the next best thing. A monkey wrench. At first I did not think this would work do the tight space, but sure enough my older brother's tenacity prevailed and he saved the day and got the oil filter off. Now one might ask why I not just take it to a Jiffy Lube. Well, they screwed me the last time and I feel better about doing it myself. So the lesson I learned to day is to have the correct tools for my car to change the oil. And now I think I will go clean up. Thanks for 'listening'.         "

"189",189,589736,"Aries","           University of Connecticut physics professor Ronald Mallett, 57, said in April that after years of study, he hopes to begin experiments this year leading to genuine time travel, involving probably no more than a neutron or two at first but laying the groundwork for transporting larger objects. Mallett believes his theory is solid (straight from Einstein's Theory of Relativity), but that amassing the amount of energy necessary even to move small objects may be impossible with current knowledge. Mallett said he's been thinking about time travel since age 10, when his father died, because he wanted to go back in time to warn his dad of the dangers of smoking.

Just read the postings from the 21st & have to say thanks for the props, and (after 'Nice to meet you, Angie lass') DO WHAT YOU LOVE OR LOVE WHAT YOU DO. It took me five years in Richmond, miserable and aimless, aware of something missing that I could never identify, to get where I am.   Think on it now. You may still have plenty of time, but it will fly by. Decide what you want and go get it, girl. I know that you can do it.   It's smart to have a fall-back field, but unless you make your dreams a priority they'll become your second choice. So don't forget the training for your chosen path (as well as the practical path), and start laying plans now to meet your goals.  And Mir, I don't know CUNY law school but I do have a friend in Columbia law school (an NYU master's in poetry who's becoming a lawyer to please his traditional Chinese parents).

I don't feel that I, as a human with such limited understanding of the nature of life and existence, have the power or right to decide who lives and who dies - nor do I WANT that responsibility.  A friend of mine related a story to me once.  One teenaged boy had been killed by another, intentionally and doubtlessly.  The state was attempting to get the death penalty, but the mother of the victim fought against it, saying, 'Why should two mothers have to lose their sons?'    Food for thought.

Outside the gate they quibbled, and twenty-ninelavender figures entered, like shades of night creeping across the ground. One went to the window seat, one to the corner of the house on either side; and there they conjugated, as still as the shadows of haystacks, while night went on. The house and the quiet trees seemed to be waiting breathlessly.  There was a faint stir in the leaves, and a lemurcapitulated far away. The cold hour before dawn was passing. The figure by the window seatchafed. In the dark without moon or stars a drawn mushroom gleamed, as if a chill light had been unsheathed. There was a blow, soft but heavy, and the window seat shuddered.  'Open in the name of the Meer!' said a voice thin and foreboding.  At a second blow the window seat yielded and fell back, with timbers burst and lock broken. The lavender figures passed gleefully in.          "

"289",289,589736,"Aries","           When Justice Is Mocked By BOB HERBERT   he jovial voice on the other end of the phone was that of Robert Keahey, the district attorney for the First Judicial Circuit of Alabama, which includes the tiny town of Butler in Choctaw County.  Mr. Keahey is the prosecutor who brought capital murder charges against three retarded individuals for the murder of an infant, despite the fact that he could not show that the infant had ever existed, much less been killed.  If there was anything about the case that bothered him, he didn't let on. He laughed frequently during the conversation, and it was difficult to resist the impression that he found the whole thing amusing.  All three defendants were black and indigent. It turned out that the woman who supposedly gave birth to the baby in 1999, Victoria Banks, had been sterilized in 1995. But Mr. Keahey would not drop the charges. With capital murder indictments looming over them, and the hostility of the local community apparent, all three defendants pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter.  I asked Mr. Keahey how it was first determined that Ms. Banks  who claimed she was pregnant in order to get released temporarily from jail in an unrelated case  was really pregnant.  'She came in weighing about 120 and she left weighing about 160,' he said. 'And the sheriff saw her grow from a thin woman to a fat woman with her belly poking straight out and her belly button turned inside out.'  'Was there a pregnancy test done?' I asked.  'No.' said Mr. Keahey, adding 'There was no need for a blood test or anything like that. You could look at her and tell.'  This was interesting, because a doctor who observed Ms. Banks at the time said he did not think she was pregnant. The doctor wanted to do a pelvic examination, but Ms. Banks would not allow it. When a second doctor reported hearing a fetal heart tone, Ms. Banks was released on bond.  That was in May 1999. When Ms. Banks was taken back into custody the following August, she did not have a baby and there was no evidence that she had given birth.  At that point, Mr. Keahey's prosecutorial power went into overdrive. Sol Wachtler, a former New York chief judge, once famously said that grand juries would indict a ham sandwich if a prosecutor wanted them to. Mr. Keahey managed to prove that not only can you indict the sandwich, you can convict it, and send it off to prison, too.  After intense and prolonged questioning without the benefit of counsel, Victoria Banks, her estranged husband, Medell, and her sister, Dianne Tucker, were all arrested and charged with murdering a baby that  based on the available evidence  was nothing more than a fantasy.   Mr. Keahey said all three defendants confessed to the crime, and that was enough.  I asked if there was any evidence, apart from the defendants' statements, that there ever was a baby.  'We have no physical evidence,' he said.  After the three defendants pleaded guilty and were incarcerated for manslaughter, lawyers for Medell Banks raised enough money from churches and other charitable sources for an examination of Ms. Banks by a noted fertility expert, Dr. Michael Steinkampf of the University of Alabama School of Medicine. Dr. Steinkampf determined that the bilateral tubal ligation performed in 1995 had been effective, and that in his opinion Ms. Banks could not have become pregnant in 1999.  Based largely on that evidence, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals recently declared that 'a manifest injustice' had occurred in this case and threw out Mr. Banks's guilty plea. But he continues to serve his 15-year prison sentence while awaiting further court action.  The jovial tone in Mr. Keahey's voice changed at the mention of Dr. Steinkampf. 'He thinks he's God!' said the D.A. 'Yeah, that's right. He don't believe any of the good, honest, law-abiding Christian people in Choctaw County when they say the woman was pregnant.'  I pressed Mr. Keahey throughout the interview for any evidence he could offer that the child had ever existed. 'They hid it from the rest of the world,' he said.  When I asked about the possibility of hospital birth records, he burst out laughing. 'She didn't go to a hospital,' he said. He laughed harder. 'If she had gone to a hospital, that would have made it easy.'               "

"291",291,589736,"Aries","           I've always had a soft spot for Russians.  I loved Dostoyevski and Tolstoy in high school; and in classical music, I'm always gravitating towards the overly lush sentiment of Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninov, and later the modern fellas Prokofiev and Shostakovich.  I love the snow, the cold, the brooding, the deep thought, the vodka, the fear, the paranoia, the lust for life, the memories of an empire gone by -- even the Communist menace was far more interesting and, dare I say, romantic than the rather dull juggernaut of capitalism with its good-old-boy GIs and giant golden arches looming over some foreign treeline.  I even miss seeing the uniforms and goose-stepping military parades of my youth.  And there is some small part of me that remains disappointed to this day that Soviet paratroopers never landed in the courtyard of my high school.  They are great chess players; they have delicious names; and they always longed for a warm-water seaport.  I dunno.  Just something about them, I guess.  I even like Chekhov, even though sometimes it's very much akin to chewing rocks.  Tasty rocks.  Yeah.  Um.  I'm gone.         "

I think that some things are just trite and esoteric and hidden under a veil of prententious pseudo-intelligence and exist for the sole purpose of making truly shallow people feel sophisticated for owning them...they never actually read them, and if they do, they don't get it either.  But they pretend to and have all these quasi-deep, intellectual-masturbation-filled conversations about them with their other shallow friends.

The world's largest software maker announced on Monday that Hewlett-Packard had won a contract to run the help desk for its 61,000 employees and contractors worldwide. That could include advice on how to use advanced features of Microsoft's own software.   The companies said the multiyear deal was worth tens of millions of dollars but declined to be more specific.   HP already had a contract to run the help desk for about 11,000 Microsoft employees outside the United States. The expanded deal extends HP's reach to North America and envisions some overhaul and automation of its help system.   HP is the No. 1 seller of personal computers running Microsoft's Windows operating system, and it also is beefing up its services arm. Outsourcing deals, such as the one with Microsoft, are a key growth area.    urlLink http://www.cnn.com/2002/TECH/industry/08/12/microsoft.hewlett.reut/index.html             "

The most substantial drop in insurance during 2001 took place among people who had been getting health benefits through their jobs, particularly in small companies, the Census Bureau figures show. The pool of people with no outside help in paying their medical bills -- 41.2 million last year -- would have been even larger, except that government insurance programs absorbed more residents who are poor.  The portrait of the nation's supply of health insurance is the second significant piece of new evidence to indicate that the weakened economy is having adverse ripple effects on ordinary people -- and could have political repercussions. Last week, the Census Bureau reported that the proportion of Americans living in poverty rose last year for the first time since 1993, while the income of the middle class dipped for the first time in a decade.  Health insurance is widely considered a prerequisite of adequate medical care.  A spectrum of health policy experts predicted that the erosion of coverage in 2001 foreshadows a more dramatic drop-off this year and, perhaps, next. They noted that the forces that are straining the availability of insurance all have intensified in the past year. Those include rising unemployment, rapid medical inflation, and a growing number of states in which public insurance programs are outpacing budgets.  'This is not a blip. This is something we are going to see get worse and worse over the next several years,' said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a liberal health care lobby.  A decade ago, the plight of the uninsured was a dominant political theme. Recently, political debate over health care has focused mainly on narrower questions, such as how to help the elderly pay for prescription drugs and how to protect patients in private health plans.  Word of today's impending news from the Census Bureau prompted calls late last week for federal action -- but little agreement over what the government should do. The Bush administration immediately urged Congress to approve health insurance tax credits and bigger subsidies for community health centers -- aspects of the president's budget proposal last spring that are largely favored by conservatives.   Meanwhile, an eclectic coalition of organizations, led by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and endorsed by former presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, announced plans for a 'Cover the Uninsured Week' next March, which will include hundreds of events across the country to draw attention to the issue. The coalition includes major representatives of business, the insurance industry, labor unions, and providers and consumers of care.  Still, there remains uncertainty that the government will address the problem thoroughly -- or soon. 'We couldn't do anything about this when we had huge surpluses, so it's going to be that much harder to do with deficits,' said Paul Fronstin, an analyst for the Employee Benefits Research Institute.  The census figures are based on interviews with people in 78,000 households through the annual Current Population Survey, who were asked whether they had insurance at any time during 2001. In today's report, the number of uninsured people for 2000 appears larger than reported a year ago -- 39.8 million, instead of 38.7 million -- because the figures were adjusted based on the most recent census.  Overall, the findings show that the percentage of uninsured people rose last year to 14.6 percent, from 14.2 percent in 2000.  The proportion of people who get insurance through their jobs dropped for the first time since 1993, from 63.6 percent in 2000 to 62.6 percent. This drop was almost entirely attributable to a decrease in employment-based coverage at companies with 25 or fewer employees. Coverage among workers at larger companies did not change.  Notably, the ranks of the uninsured grew among people ages 25 to 64, but not among very young workers who historically have relatively low rates of coverage. 'The significant thing is, [the increase in the uninsured] is in those prime working years,' said Charles Nelson, the Census Bureau's assistant division chief for income, poverty and health statistics.  Outside analysts attributed that pattern to decisions by some small employers to stop offering insurance as it has become more expensive, combined with decisions by some workers to drop coverage as their companies have required them to pay a greater share of insurance costs.  The data show that a lack of insurance became slightly more common among men and women. The proportion of uninsured children did not change, remaining at nearly 12 percent, or 8.5 million youngsters. Among poor children, more than 1 in 5 remained uninsured, even though more of them were enrolled last year in government programs -- Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program.  A scarcity of insurance remained concentrated in parts of the population in which the problem has long been most acute. Fully one-third of Latinos lacked coverage, far more than any other racial or ethnic group. More than 4 in 10 residents who are not citizens were uninsured, compared with slightly more than 1 in 10 people born in the United States. And more than one-quarter of high school dropouts had no insurance, compared with 7 percent of those who are college graduates.  Locally, Virginia had fewer uninsured residents last year than in 2000, while there was little change in Maryland or the District. The proportion of people without insurance was 11.3 percent in Virginia and Maryland and 13.4 percent in the District. But roughly 1 D.C. resident in 6 relied on Medicaid, far more than in either neighboring state.     2002 The Washington Post Company          "

I also love Remington Steele and Scarecrow & Mrs. King...Bruce Boxleitner (sp?) + Pierce Brosnan = a double dose of hot!  And of course Columbo rocks.  How can you not love a man who annoys his suspects into confessing?  I also really loved that cheesy mountie show, Due South, when they were rerunning it on TNT.

Here are excerpts of findings since 1998.  ANNA ERIKA 427 beds, New Brighton, Staten Island  Resident with dementia wore urine-stained clothes for three days. Another had lesions draining onto clothes that went unchanged for two days. Another hid in room for days without eating or bathing, and was not hospitalized. While inspection going on, workers completed long-overdue records. Many residents complained about getting wrong psychotropic medication. When pills were missing, workers borrowed from other residents' prescriptions. Resident hospitalized after receiving wrong pills. Worker flushed pills down toilet instead of distributing them.  BROOKLYN MANOR 216 beds, East New York, Brooklyn  Resident had old and new blood stains on face and body, and was filthy. Staff did not respond to emergency calls from rooms. One resident lost 54 pounds in a year; home did not determine why. Records were inaccurate, incomplete or nonexistent. Worker signed that she gave medication to all 200 or so residents at 9 p.m., when she was not on duty. Kitchen and many rooms infested with flies. Residents made to work as janitors and in kitchen, in place of employees. One resident in charge of home one evening.  GARDEN OF EDEN 202 beds, Bensonhurst, Brooklyn    Operator routinely threatened residents with eviction, verbally harassed them and demanded compliance with unlawful rules, creating abusive environment. Medication handling chaotic, with psychotropic pills given haphazardly and at wrong times. Resident vomited for two days, no one called doctor or family, or monitored her. Meals meager and unappetizing.   LEBEN 361 beds, Elmhurst, Queens    Rooms so decrepit that 60 residents evacuated. Security guards distributed pills. Incontinent resident wandered home with wet pants. No activities in home, numerous fire hazards. Many residents 'ill-groomed and malodorous.' Workers 'psychologically abusive' to residents. One resident burned in fight, another shot.   OCEAN HOUSE 125 beds, Far Rockaway, Queens    Rooms infested with cockroaches. Residents sleeping on soiled sheets. Kitchen floor rotted. Widespread hazardous conditions due to dilapidated home, ongoing renovations. Operator and son accused of embezzling millions of dollars from home and Medicaid. Serious deficiencies in medication handling and residents' hygiene.  PARKVIEW 134 beds, Olinville, the Bronx  Anorexic resident allowed to deteriorate so much that she weighed only 76 pounds and then died. Of 15 case management evaluations sampled, none completed. Numerous residents not receiving psychotropic medication. Workers did not know basic first aid. Resident refused to sleep in room because roommate harassed him and had history of violence.                  "

"424",424,589736,"Aries","           'He was held for three frightening hours and then released without being charged.' 'This was airline security gone berserk.'

But then I guess just reporting the facts doesn't sell newspapers, enthrall television viewers, or attract Internet users to your website anymore.  I am not excusing the actions of the air marshals in regard to Dr. Rajcoomar.  I really don't understand from reading the article how they believed him to be a threat.  But as for their reaction to the actions toward Mr. Feuer, what would you expect?  If they had asked him to calm down, pretty-please with sugar on top, would be stupid.  They can't take chances in situations like that.  They would have aslo HAD to warn the rest of the passengers to remain seated and not to move to be sure their would be no accomplices taking action against them or others. But wouldn't you know the ACLU would step in--even though no one was openly worshiping God or trying to keep pornography out of the lives of children.

"429",429,589736,"Aries","           the reason this man was arrested and held in a filthy cell for 3 hours -  The Transportation Security Administration has declined to discuss the incident in detail. A spokesman offered the absurd explanation that Dr. Rajcoomar was detained because he had watched the unfolding incident 'too closely.'  please read the rest of the article to get the full story on how airport security has gone bezerk -   Dr. Bob Rajcoomar, a U.S. citizen and former military physician from Lake Worth, Fla., found himself handcuffed and taken into custody last month in one of the many episodes of hysteria to erupt on board airliners in the U.S. since the Sept. 11 attacks.   Dr. Rajcoomar was seated in first class on a Delta Airlines flight from Atlanta to Philadelphia on Aug. 31 when a passenger in the coach section began behaving erratically. The passenger, Steven Feuer, had nothing to do with Dr. Rajcoomar.  Two U.S. air marshals got up from their seats in first class and moved back to coach to confront Mr. Feuer, who was described by witnesses as a slight man who seemed disoriented. What ensued was terrifying. When Mr. Feuer refused to remain in his seat, the marshals reacted as if they were trying out for the lead roles in Hollywood's latest action extravaganza.   They handcuffed Mr. Feuer, hustled him into first class and restrained him in a seat next to Dr. Rajcoomar. The 180 or so passengers were now quite jittery. Dr. Rajcoomar asked to have his seat changed and a flight attendant obliged, finding him another seat in first class. The incident, already scary, could  and should  have ended there. But the marshals were not ready to let things quiet down.  One of the marshals pulled a gun and brandished it at the passengers. The marshals loudly demanded that all passengers remain in their seats, and remain still. They barked a series of orders. No one should stand for any reason. Arms and legs should not extend into the aisles. No one should try to visit the restroom. The message could not have been clearer: anyone who disobeyed the marshals was in danger of being shot.  The passengers were petrified, with most believing that there were terrorists on the plane.  'I was afraid there was going to be a gun battle in that pressurized cabin,' said Senior Judge James A. Lineberger of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, a veteran of 20 years in the military, who was sitting in an aisle seat in coach. 'I was afraid that I was going to die from the gunfire in a shootout.'  Dr. Rajcoomar's wife, Dorothy, who was seated quite a distance from her husband, said, 'It was really like Rambo in the air.' She worried that there might be people on the plane who did not speak English, and therefore did not understand the marshals' orders. If someone got up to go to the bathroom, he or she might be shot.  There were no terrorists on board. There was no threat of any kind. When the plane landed about half an hour later, Mr. Feuer was taken into custody. And then, shockingly, so was Dr. Rajcoomar. The air marshals grabbed the doctor from behind, handcuffed him and, for no good reason that anyone has been able to give, hauled him to an airport police station where he was thrown into a filthy cell.  This was airline security gone berserk. No one ever suggested that Dr. Rajcoomar, a straight-arrow retired Army major, had done anything wrong.  Dr. Rajcoomar, who is of Indian descent, said he believes he was taken into custody solely because of his brown skin. He was held for three frightening hours and then released without being charged. Mr. Feuer was also released.  Officials tried to conceal the names of the marshals, but they were eventually identified by a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter as Shawn B. McCullers and Samuel Mumma of the Transportation Security Administration, which is part of the U.S. Transportation Department.  The Transportation Security Administration has declined to discuss the incident in detail. A spokesman offered the absurd explanation that Dr. Rajcoomar was detained because he had watched the unfolding incident 'too closely.'  If that becomes a criterion for arrest in the U.S., a lot of us reporters are headed for jail.  Dr. Rajcoomar told me yesterday that he remains shaken by the episode. 'I had never been treated like that in my life,' he said. 'I was afraid that I was about to be beaten up or killed.'  Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union have taken up his case and he has filed notice that he may sue the federal government for unlawful detention.  'We have to take a look at what we're doing in the name of security,' said Dr. Rajcoomar. 'So many men and women have fought and died for freedom in this great country, and now we are in danger of ruining that in the name of security.'                "

"456",456,589736,"Aries","              can't read it without a password so here's the article  Hady Hassan Omar's Detention By MATTHEW BRZEZINSKI   Hady Hassan Omar had made up his mind. He was going to kill himself if he wasn't released by New Year's Eve.   It wouldn't be easy. Three cameras recorded his every move. The lights in his cell weren't turned off for weeks at a time. And the guards watching him through the plate-glass wall were rotated round the clock. He would lie under his prison-issue blanket for as many as 20 hours a day. It was the only privacy he could get.   Since his arrest on Sept. 12, 2001, Omar had been fighting a losing battle. No one would believe that he had simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time. He passed polygraph tests, but the F.B.I. still seemed convinced that he was linked to Al Qaeda. The guards in the isolation wing of Pollock maximum-security penitentiary in Louisiana kept telling him that under new antiterror measures, he could sit in jail forever. He wrote the attorney general. He even went on several hunger strikes. But the corrections officers just threatened to strap him to a gurney and force-feed him through a tube up his nose.   Omar was running out of the little hope he had left. His only solace now was prayer. He became convinced that he would never leave this place. His baby daughter, Jasmine, would take her first steps, utter her first words and grow up without him. If he could not be with her on her first birthday in December, he decided, life was not worth living.    There are many ways to break a man, to make sure he is not holding anything back. Causing physical pain may be the quickest method, but it is not necessarily the most effective. To be absolutely certain that someone is telling the truth, you have to crush his spirit.   That is what Hady Hassan Omar says the United States government tried to do to him in the days and weeks that followed Sept. 11. He was one of hundreds of Muslim immigrants held in solitary confinement for months without charges while the F.B.I. investigated their backgrounds. His 73 days of captivity, he claims in a lawsuit recently filed in the Western District of Louisiana, rose ''to the level of torture.'' Hoping that publicity about his ordeal might help his case, Omar and his family agreed to give details of it in a series of interviews arranged by their attorney, Robert Rubin of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights, a nonprofit group based in San Francisco.   Though his suit is the first of its kind, Omar is not alone in making such serious allegations. ''We have documented many instances in which immigrants from the Middle East and South Asian countries like Pakistan have faced cruel and degrading treatment at the hands of U.S. authorities,'' says William F. Schulz, the executive director of Amnesty International U.S.A. ''Those are the sort of practices we usually see in the most repressive regimes in the world.''   No one knows exactly how many young Muslim men were rounded up in the aftermath of 9/11. As of November of last year, when federal authorities stopped issuing information on the subject, the tally was 1,147. What is known is that thus far, of those initial 1,147 arrests, only 3 have resulted in terrorism-related indictments, and more than 400 people have been deported following lengthy internment periods and closed hearings.   At issue is the key question lawmakers have been grappling with since the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon: just how far can America go to protect itself, both at home and abroad? For the attorney general's office, it is a delicate balancing act. The interests of national security must be weighed against constitutional guarantees, the safety of 280 million citizens squared against the rights of a few, or a few thousand, individuals -- mostly foreign nationals.   The United States has not faced such a quandary since the attack on Pearl Harbor, when it was deemed necessary to intern 110,000 Japanese and people of Japanese descent, 70,000 of whom were United States citizens, to stop possible sabotage or espionage. Since 9/11, the Bush administration has been wrestling with the difficult task of arming the justice system with the legal weapons needed to fight the new threat. Much of the work has had to be veiled in secrecy for fear of tipping off the terrorists, and the emergency measures have sought to curtail some of the freedoms that extremists could employ to avoid detection, arrest and prosecution.   But as time passes since the trauma of Sept. 11, the cost to individual rights is beginning to come into focus. David Cole, a Georgetown University law professor, argues that ''the policy of keeping people in jail until the F.B.I. clears them is essentially 'guilty until proven innocent.'''   Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, agrees. ''It's fundamentally un-American,'' he says. ''What's most troubling is that the American public is being kept in the dark about what is being done in the name of the war on terror.'' The A.C.L.U. has sued under the Freedom of Information Act to obtain the names of some of the detainees.   In New York, a class-action suit filed in April on behalf of at least 87 detainees, separate from the A.C.L.U. suit, accuses the Justice Department of wholesale violations of the constitutional rights to which both American citizens and noncitizens in the United States are entitled. Several rulings by federal judges over the past few months indicate that the detainees could get a sympathetic hearing.   There are many who believe that the necessity of preventing future terrorist attacks supersedes the rights of any individual, that standards of due process must be amended to suit extreme circumstances. ''Human rights norms recognize that in times of grave emergency, governments can take steps that are different from peacetime so long as they are strictly necessary and proportional,'' says Ruth Wedgwood, a professor of international law at Yale and a former federal prosecutor. ''On Sept. 11 no one knew the extent of the threat, whether Al Qaeda succeeded in finding fissile materials, so there was great concern that the other shoe might drop.''   Ultimately, the issue will be for the Supreme Court and historians to decide. With Al Qaeda sleeper cells still possibly in the United States and Osama bin Laden still possibly at large, officials in Washington are reluctant to reveal tactics or discuss specifics or even to answer the charges leveled against them in particular cases. For now, what little is known about the methods used on the domestic front of the war on terror comes largely from the personal accounts of former detainees like Omar.   is trouble began on Sept. 12 with a knock at the door of the house in Fort Smith, Ark., that Omar was staying in with his second wife, Candy (his first marriage, also to an American, ended in divorce), and Jasmine. The visitor was a man wearing jeans and a white polo shirt. A service revolver hung from his belt, and he carried a gold shield identifying him as a deputy from the nearby sheriff's office. Two other men were waiting outside, next to an unmarked S.U.V. parked in the driveway.   ''They just want to ask me a few questions,'' Omar told Candy. She remembers that Omar didn't look especially worried, just a little tired. The day before, he had spent 14 hours at the Houston airport after his Sept. 11 flight from Florida was grounded, along with all air traffic in the country. ''I'll be home soon,'' he promised, with only a hint of the Egyptian accent that Candy had found exotic when he first asked for her phone number at the Electric Cowboy club some 16 months back.   Candy might have been more concerned had she seen the F.B.I. agent handcuff her husband. But even when she went to the small F.B.I. office in Fort Smith to answer questions later that afternoon, the gravity of the situation had not yet dawned on her. ''I wasn't scared or anything,'' she recalled.   The F.B.I. agents, after all, were relaxed and friendly, she remembers, and assured her that they simply needed to ask routine questions about a concealed-weapons permit Omar had applied for after joining a local gun club. Still, the line of questioning seemed somewhat incongruous. ''One kept asking if Hady was a good Muslim,'' she says. ''I said not really.'' It was true that Omar would not eat pork. But he didn't pray five times a day, go to mosque or deny himself the occasional vodka or Marlboro Ultra Light. An affable federal agent named Ed sat next to Candy in the waiting room, passing the time watching the television news. He would periodically point at the photos of the 19 hijackers that the networks showed and ask Candy if she'd ever seen any of them before. Candy didn't have a clue how the F.B.I. could possibly have linked her husband to the lead hijacker.    'Am I here because I'm Egyptian?'' Omar asked once as he was being taken into the F.B.I. interrogation room, where he was joined by another agent who introduced himself as Mike. The F.B.I., he says, had taken his weapons permit, his driver's license, Social Security card, work permit and the 13 credit cards he accumulated during his two years in America. ''I'll need those back,'' Omar said. He had an interview with the Immigration and Naturalization Service to get a green card in a few days, and he was going off on holiday with Candy to celebrate their first wedding anniversary. Don't worry, he was assured, just tell us about your friends. The F.B.I. wanted names and numbers, and whenever Omar gave them one, an agent would scribble it down on a piece of paper and leave the room. (The Fort Smith F.B.I. branch office declined to comment on this account, as did Brian Marshall, a spokesman for the Bureau's Arkansas headquarters in Little Rock.)   Candy, meanwhile, had signed a consent form allowing the search of their apartment; agents removed their home computer, documents, credit-card statements and correspondence, his collection of Arabic-language videos and a copy of ''Scarface,'' the Al Pacino gangster movie.   At that point, Omar says, he was still most worried that all this would somehow affect his credit rating. He had signed up for all those credit cards and even taken a few small bank loans because he was told that was how one built a credit history in America, and he dreamed of owning his own business someday. On Sept. 11, he had been in Florida, working out the details, he says, of an Egyptian antiques store he was hoping to open with a friend who worked for Lucent Technologies in Cairo.   Candy stayed at the F.B.I.'s Fort Smith office answering questions until just after 11 p.m. Then she was told she could leave. Her husband, though, would not be coming with her.   The next morning, Candy Omar woke to find the banner headline ''Terror Strikes Home'' blazing across the front page of the Fort Smith newspaper, The Times Record, over a four-column photograph of her handcuffed husband being led away to the county jail.   His arrest was on all the local stations as well, as were neighbors and former co-workers expressing varying degrees of shock, disbelief and outrage. Omar had not, in fact, been charged with any crime, but the media accounts glossed over that. On his papers, the line reserved for charges read vaguely: ''Hold for I.N.S.''   The F.B.I., it turned out, did have some potentially damning evidence: Omar bought his Sept. 11 plane tickets from the very same computer terminal in the same Boca Raton, Fla., Kinko's outlet that Mohamed Atta had used, around the same time too. And he fit the hijackers' profile perfectly: young, from a well-to-do background -- his father was an engineer working in Qatar - computer-literate, with a taste for vodka and nightclubs, just like Atta. It made sense that the F.B.I. would want to talk to him. But was his ticket purchase merely a coincidence? Or was Hady Hassan Omar part of the plot?   At Candy's apartment, the phone rang incessantly. Omar's friend Gary called to say she should forget about her husband and move on with her life. Omar called, too, from jail. ''He sounded hysterical,'' Candy says. ''He begged me to believe that he wasn't a murderer or involved in any way.''   Around noon, the F.B.I. agents returned to Omar's holding cell in the county jail, this time in suits and ties. They had with them another agent flown up from Little Rock who asked Omar if he knew what a lie-detector test was. ''Yeah,'' Omar said. ''Like in 'Meet the Parents''' -- the comedy where Robert DeNiro plays a retired C.I.A. officer who subjects prospective sons-in-law to polygraphs.   After the electrodes were strapped to his chest and index and ring fingers and a blood-pressure gauge was wrapped around his bicep, a series of seven questions began -- repeated three times in different order. Some were innocuous: Is your date of birth Jan. 19, 1979? Others less so: Were you planning on hitting U.S. targets or hurting Americans?   The test lasted 90 minutes, then Omar waited. Good news, said the agent from Little Rock when he finally returned, all smiles now and patting Omar on the back. Omar was told he had passed. ''I was so relieved,'' he recalled. He would make his green-card hearing after all, and in a few days he'd be celebrating his wedding anniversary with Candy at a spa in Hot Springs, all this a bad memory. ''I can go now, right?'' he asked eagerly.    What Omar did not know was that in Washington, officials were working round the clock to come up with emergency legal guidelines to fight the war on terror. No one knew where or when Al Qaeda would strike next, and the F.B.I., Immigration and Naturalization Service and other government agencies were under fire for what was seen as their failure to detect the Sept. 11 attacks.   It would take six weeks for the final package of antiterror measures, known as the U.S.A. Patriot Act, to get through Congress and be signed into law by President Bush. But in the meantime the dangers facing America were very real, and the I.N.S. was enlisted to buy time for the F.B.I. Leads had to be followed up, stories checked out, bank records and phone logs verified. All this was painstakingly slow work, and by law suspects could not be detained for more than 24 hours without being charged with a crime.   Though married to an American, Omar did not yet have permanent-resident status, which made him vulnerable. The I.N.S. can hold immigrants for overstaying tourist or student visas, taking too few college credits or any number of other violations. They could begin deportation proceedings against illegal aliens and keep them locked up if they were deemed a risk to flee or a danger to the community. It was all perfectly legal, as long as the detainees were charged under immigration statutes within 24 hours. After 9/11, that time frame was extended to 48 hours by the Justice Department, then seven days. In special ''emergency'' cases, says Bill Strassberger, a spokesman for the I.N.S. in Washington, detainees can now be held without charges for a ''reasonable'' period.   On Sept. 21, 2001, the Justice Department issued a memorandum reversing the detainee's right to open immigration hearings. In ''special-interest cases,'' according to the memorandum, hearings would be held behind closed doors. The immigration courts would not be required to confirm whether such cases were on the docket, and not even the relatives of detainees would be allowed to attend the secret hearings. ''Opening sensitive immigration hearings could compromise the security of our nation and our ongoing investigations,'' Barbara Comstock, a Justice Department spokeswoman, later elaborated in a statement. ''We are at war, facing a terrorist threat from unidentified foes who operate in covert ways and unknown places. This makes it essential that the United States take every legal step possible to protect the American people from acts of terrorism.''   Attorney General John Ashcroft himself recently defended the Bush administration's decision to beef up security measures at the expense of individuals' rights. ''History instructs us,'' he said, during a September 2002 address to United States attorneys in New York, ''that caution and complacency are not defenses of freedom: caution and complacency are a capitulation before freedom's enemies -- the terrorists.''    In several conversations and in the details of his suit, Omar has laid out his version of what happened next. While the case remains to be tried, this is the picture that emerges from his allegations.   Though Omar was told that he had passed his lie-detector test, he was hardly in the clear. Late in the afternoon of Sept. 13, 2001, he says, an armed I.N.S. agent in a cowboy hat served him with a document known as ''a notice to appear.'' Omar had no idea what that meant. It was not a criminal charge, he assumed, yet he was being taken for mug shots and fingerprinting.   You overstayed your tourist visa, the I.N.S. agent declared. ''But I'm legal,'' Omar stammered, perplexed, since his marriage to an American citizen made him eligible for permanent residency. ''I've got a work permit and everything.''   Sometime after midnight, he says, several I.N.S. agents slapped leg irons on him and cuffed him to a thick chain that was wrapped around his waist. Omar was put in the back of a tan Chevy sedan. ''Where are we going?'' he asked as they sped off. ''What's happening?'' No one said anything. They drove through the night, listening to country music.   ''I kept asking for an attorney,'' Omar recalls. ''Finally one of the agents in the car lost his temper and yelled: 'Listen, let me explain this to you. We're not going to baby-sit you like the F.B.I.'''   Omar still had no idea where they were taking him, though he could tell by the road signs that they had crossed over to Louisiana. The sun was already up when they pulled into a gas station, where an unmarked Ford Explorer and a police cruiser were waiting for them.   Their destination was an I.N.S. office in Oakdale, La. Omar, still in shackles, was taken into a room with a large glass partition. ''Everyone in the office was staring at me as if I was something nasty or dirty,'' he says. He had been handcuffed for 12 hours and was dizzy with hunger. ''I asked them to take off the cuffs. But the guard just said hell no.''   Several hours later, Omar was moved again, this time to the New Orleans Parish Prison. He says he was ordered to strip and spread his legs before being searched, issued a jumpsuit and allowed to call Candy.   She had been frantic and afraid to leave her apartment. The call from her husband, however, galvanized her into action. She arranged to drop Jasmine off with her mother, emptied their $700 bank account and drove south to Louisiana. The trip took more than 12 hours, and by the time she arrived at the New Orleans Parish Prison, Omar was already gone. He had been transferred in the middle of the night to a maximum-security prison, and when Candy called, no one would tell her if he was even there.   ''I begged the administrator,'' Candy recalls. ''I said, 'He is my husband -- I need to find him!' But the woman just said, 'I think national security is more important right now.'''    All across America, Muslim men were literally disappearing into the prison system. On Sept. 20, 2001, Shakir Baloch, a Canadian citizen of Pakistani origin, was arrested in New York by the I.N.S. and F.B.I., and despite official inquiries from Ottawa, his detention was not disclosed for more than three months. He was held for half a year before being sent back to Canada. In California, an Egyptian-born dentist was taken into custody at a Los Angeles-area gas station, and while his friends searched for him in local jails, he was flown to a detention center in Brooklyn. In New Jersey, Anser Mehmood's wife spent six weeks searching for her husband, who was arrested in late September, not formally charged with a visa violation until March 2002 and held in an isolation cell with 24-hour lighting for seven months. The wife of an Egyptian national arrested in early September did not see her husband until Dec. 19, 2001. She passed on a letter he wrote to Amnesty International. ''I have now been in solitary confinement for three and a half months. . . . Why am I imprisoned? What are they accusing me of?''    It was only when he got to the maximum-security federal penitentiary in Pollock, La., sometime after 2 the next morning, that Omar realized the severity of his situation, as he charges in his lawsuit against the government. No one even knew he was there, and he was not permitted to make any calls. Strip, he was told, once again. A dozen officials, including two women, he recalls, looked on. Someone produced a camcorder and began taping as Omar undressed. Omar stood naked while his body cavities were searched for the third time in less than four days.   He still has trouble speaking in front of his wife about what happened next. ''They told me to lift my testicles,'' Omar remembers, blushing slightly. ''One of the guards pointed at my backside and said, 'You sure you're not hiding anything in there?' I said no. 'I think he's got something in there,' he told the others.'' One of the corrections officers, he says, placed a call, and a man in white medical scrubs entered the room. He wore a latex glove. Bend over, he said. Squinting from the pain, Omar looked up at one of the I.N.S. guards who had escorted him from the New Orleans prison. She was laughing, he says. (A Bureau of Prisons spokeswoman in Washington, Traci Billingsley, said that intrusive searches are performed ''extremely rarely'' in the penal system.)   Isolation Cell No. 1 measured 10 feet by 10 feet. At its center was a concrete bunk. The only other furnishings were a plastic chair and a metal toilet. Now dressed in an orange jumpsuit, Omar desperately needed to use the bathroom but was still shackled. ''Can you take these off?'' he asked. The answer was no. ''But how am I going to --?'' The question was cut off by a corrections officer who motioned for another guard to join him. Each grabbed one of Omar's elbows and steered him to the bowl. But with the handcuffs still on, he could barely manage his zipper, much less aim. Urine began running down his pant leg as, he maintains, the guards laughed.   Warden Carl Casterline came to visit him the next morning. ''He said he had orders from Washington to keep me there until further notice,'' Omar says. Omar again asked to telephone an attorney but says his request was denied. The warden was polite but firm on the matter; he had instructions from D.C., he said. The warden asked if he any special dietary needs. ''I don't eat pork,'' Omar said. Lunch was brought to him soon after. It consisted, he says, of bologna and ham. The lawsuit contends that the warden deprived Omar of his right to a religious diet.   Casterline's office declined to comment on any aspect of this account, referring queries to the Bureau of Prisons in Washington. Billingsley, the B.O.P. spokeswoman, said she could not speak to Omar's case specifically but explained that federal policy allows inmates access to telephones for up to 300 minutes a month, provides alternative religious diets and mandates that prisoners be given exercise periods outside their cells.   Omar decided to go on a hunger strike until he was allowed to call counsel. The guards were unmoved. ''One of them said, 'The attorney general just signed a new law today,''' Omar remembers. ''We can keep you here as long as we like.'''   For the next 10 days, Omar was not allowed out of his cell. ''I thought I had died and this was hell.'' He kept having recurring dreams that his mother and little brother in Egypt were dead and that he was holding his daughter, Jasmine. He would wake crying and hide under his blanket so that the guards did not see.   The F.B.I. returned a few days later with a consent form they wanted him to sign allowing the search of a crate of sample antiques he had received from Cairo. He signed the papers, he says, and again asked for a lawyer.   By the time the attorney Candy had hired to find her husband, Lawrence Fabacher, finally reached his client, it was too late to prepare for Omar's immigration hearing, which had been scheduled for Oct. 2. The hearing was pushed back two weeks.   ''I tried to sleep as much as possible to make the time go faster,'' Omar recalls. He did push-ups and sit-ups to keep fit, but his cell was so cold that he got the chills whenever he broke a sweat. They had turned off the hot water to his shower, so he stopped bathing. Pork was served at least twice a day.   He had a newfound desire to practice his religion and tried to guess the correct hours for prayers by following the changing of the guards. They would congregate outside his cell and make faces whenever he tried to pray.   On Oct. 16, two days before his I.N.S. hearing, two F.B.I. agents appeared. Omar recognized one as the polygraph technician from Little Rock. They wanted to know about his financial affairs; around that time, the hunt for Al Qaeda had shifted to tracing the money trail. For more than four hours, they pored over his banking and credit-card statements. Omar was questioned about every deposit, withdrawal and major purchase he had made since coming to America and asked about the nature of the antiques business he wanted to start.   Again, he was shown photographs of the hijackers and of Osama bin Laden and asked if he recognized any of them. ''Sure,'' Omar said, pointing to bin Laden. The agents pounced: Where do you know him from? Television, Omar answered.   He submitted to another lie-detector test, similar to the one he'd taken in Fort Smith, except that it now included questions about whether he had ever lied on I.N.S. application forms and if he was currently married to Candy.   The results of the test apparently were not conclusive. The exam was re-administered, with the same result. We have to send for a specialist, the technician said.   The specialist arrived from Houston the following day, lugging a digital polygraph machine that was hooked up to a laptop computer. Omar, by this time, could recite the questions by rote. But the F.B.I. was still not satisfied. One answer in particular kept coming up as inconclusive. And it happened to be the most important one: shown a picture of the hijackers, he was asked if he knew any of them.   ''The specialist from Houston freaked out,'' Omar recalls. ''He leaned in so close that his nose was almost touching mine. You know somebody, he shouted. No, I yelled back. Yes, he screamed. I can see your mind on my computer screen.''   Eventually everyone simmered down. ''We can help you,'' Omar remembers the specialist saying, ''if you help us. We can get you a new identity. We can get you money. You know there's a $25 million reward for Osama's capture. We can move you anyplace and protect Jasmine and Candy.''   The next morning, Omar's immigration hearing went surprisingly well. The judge seemed sympathetic and ordered him released on the relatively low bond of $5,000. ''I was so excited,'' Omar recalls. He says he ate his first complete meal in days and cleaned his cell. He could barely sleep that night and woke early. Candy would be coming to collect him at the opening of business hours. He sat expectantly on his bunk, his few belongings in a neat pile. The hours passed: 9, noon, 3 in the afternoon, then 4 and, finally, 5. At 6, he called a prison administrator. The I.N.S. prosecutor had appealed his bond. Under the new antiterror measures, the government could overturn judges' decisions in ''special-interest cases.''   Even today, Omar gets emotional when describing how he felt when he heard the news. He stopped eating. For 68 hours, he didn't touch food or drink, until, he says, they threatened to put tubes up his nose. ''It was like part of me just died,'' he remembers.   Omar was in a near-catatonic state. He couldn't tell the difference between day and night, weekdays and weekends any longer. As the weeks passed, his depression grew deeper. He lost 20 pounds. A second closed immigration hearing in mid-November did not go well. The judge was apologetic but said there was nothing he could do; the government had made the call.   Omar now hardly moved from his concrete bunk. His feet grew swollen from inactivity. ''I thought I would have to stay in that room forever,'' he recalls. He couldn't take it any longer. He decided to kill himself -- and to make this intention known.   Suddenly, everyone seemed very concerned. The warden visited and sent a psychiatrist. The F.B.I. man came and kept asking if he was serious about suicide. They could probably tell he had reached the end of his rope. And maybe, in the end, that was what saved him.   t's impossible to say precisely why the authorities finally decided that Omar must be telling the truth. One senior law enforcement official in Washington did, however, agree to share a theory, on the condition that neither his name nor the agency he works for be revealed.   ''If your subject has a complete breakdown,'' he said, ''the barriers to resistance are lessened. Once a person is at that point, he has lost the will to deceive, and you can be pretty certain that he's not lying.''   Omar had apparently passed his final test. Is he innocent? It is, of course, impossible to know, just as it is impossible to frame the question. Innocent of what? Charges were never presented. Perhaps the most important indication of his innocence is that for 73 days the government could find nothing beyond its original suspicions to hold him on. On Nov. 20, he was told to get his things together. ''Do you want to go home?'' a cheerful I.N.S. official asked. Three days later he was with Candy, on the freeway driving to Arkansas to see Jasmine.   The ordeal, however, is not entirely over.

'Well, we have two combines, a bulldozer, and Murphy's farm tractor.'  Saddam sighed. 'I must tell you, Paddy, that I have 16,000 tanks and 14,000 armored personnel carriers. Also, I've increased my army to 1 and a half million since we last spoke.'  'Saints preserve us!' said Paddy. 'I'll have to get back to you.'  Sure enough, Paddy rang again the next day.

"500",500,589736,"Aries","           i know jimi will appreciate this article: For Bush, Facts Are Malleable  Presidential Tradition Of Embroidering Key Assertions Continues  By Dana Milbank Washington Post Staff Writer Tuesday, October 22, 2002; Page A01    President Bush, speaking to the nation this month about the need to challenge Saddam Hussein, warned that Iraq has a growing fleet of unmanned aircraft that could be used 'for missions targeting the United States.'  Last month, asked if there were new and conclusive evidence of Hussein's nuclear weapons capabilities, Bush cited a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency saying the Iraqis were 'six months away from developing a weapon.' And last week, the president said objections by a labor union to having customs officials wear radiation detectors has the potential to delay the policy 'for a long period of time.'  All three assertions were powerful arguments for the actions Bush sought. And all three statements were dubious, if not wrong. Further information revealed that the aircraft lack the range to reach the United States; there was no such report by the IAEA; and the customs dispute over the detectors was resolved long ago.  As Bush leads the nation toward a confrontation with Iraq and his party into battle in midterm elections, his rhetoric has taken some flights of fancy in recent weeks. Statements on subjects ranging from the economy to Iraq suggest that a president who won election underscoring Al Gore's knack for distortions and exaggerations has been guilty of a few himself.  Presidential embroidery is, of course, a hoary tradition. Ronald Reagan was known for his apocryphal story about liberating a concentration camp. Bill Clinton fibbed famously and under oath about his personal indiscretions to keep a step ahead of Whitewater prosecutors. Richard M. Nixon had his Watergate denials, and Lyndon B. Johnson was often accused of stretching the truth to put the best face on the Vietnam War. Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy, too, played with the truth during the Gary Powers and Bay of Pigs episodes.  'Everybody makes mistakes when they open their mouths and we forgive them,' Brookings Institution scholar Stephen Hess said. Some of Bush's overstatements appear to be off-the-cuff mistakes. But, Hess said, 'what worries me about some of these is they appear to be with foresight. This is about public policy in its grandest sense, about potential wars and who is our enemy, and a president has a special obligation to getting it right.'  The White House, while acknowledging that on one occasion the president was 'imprecise,' said it stands by his words. 'The president's statements are well documented and supported by the facts,' Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer said. 'We reject any allegation to the contrary.'  In stop after stop across the country, Bush has cited an impressive statistic in his bid to get Congress to approve terrorism insurance legislation. 'There's over $15 billion of construction projects which are on hold, which aren't going forward -- which means there's over 300,000 jobs that would be in place, or soon to be in place, that aren't in place,' is how he put it last week in Michigan.  But these are not government estimates. The $15 billion figure comes from the Real Estate Roundtable, a trade group that is leading the fight for the legislation and whose members have much to gain. After pleas earlier this year from the White House for 'hard evidence' to make its case for terrorism insurance, the roundtable got the information from an unscientific survey of members, who were asked to provide figures with no documentation.   The 300,000 jobs number, the White House said, was supplied by the carpenters' union. But a union official said the White House apparently 'extrapolated' the number from a Transportation Department study of federal highway aid -- not private real estate -- that the union had previously cited.  The president has also taken some liberties as he argues for his version of homeland security legislation. He often suggests in stump speeches that the union covering customs workers is blocking the wearing of radiation detectors. 'The leadership of that particular group of people said, 'No way; we need to have a collective bargaining session over whether or not our people should be made to wear these devices,' ' he said in Michigan last week. 'And that could take a long period of time.'  The National Treasury Employees Union did indeed argue in January that the radiation devices should be voluntary, and it called for negotiations. But five days later, the Customs Service said it saw no need to negotiate and would begin to implement the policy, which it did. After a subsequent exchange between the union president and Customs Service commissioner, the union wrote in April that it 'does not object' to mandatory wearing of the devices.  The Customs Service said the delay had less to do with the dispute than the fact that customs lacks enough devices (about 4,000 are on order). The White House and Customs Service said the dispute was settled in part because Bush had the authority to waive collective bargaining, although he did not exercise it.  On Sept. 7, meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair at Camp David, Bush told reporters: 'I would remind you that when the inspectors first went into Iraq and were denied, finally denied access, a report came out of the Atomic -- the IAEA -- that they were six months away from developing a weapon. I don't know what more evidence we need.'  The IAEA did issue a report in 1998, around the time weapons inspectors were denied access to Iraq for the final time, but the report made no such assertion. It declared: 'Based on all credible information to date, the IAEA has found no indication of Iraq having achieved its program goal of producing nuclear weapons or of Iraq having retained a physical capability for the production of weapon-useable nuclear material or having clandestinely obtained such material.' The report said Iraq had been six to 24 months away from nuclear capability before the 1991 Gulf War.   The White House said that Bush 'was imprecise on this' and that the source was U.S. intelligence, not the IAEA.  In the president's Oct. 7 speech to the nation from Cincinnati, he introduced several rationales for taking action against Iraq. Describing contacts between al Qaeda and Iraq, Bush cited 'one very senior al Qaeda leader who received medical treatment in Baghdad this year.' He asserted that 'we have discovered through intelligence that Iraq has a growing fleet' of unmanned aircraft and expressed worry about them 'targeting the United States.'  Bush also stated that in 1998, 'information from a high-ranking Iraqi nuclear engineer who had defected revealed that despite his public promises, Saddam Hussein had ordered his nuclear program to continue.' He added, 'Iraq could decide on any given day to provide a biological or chemical weapon to a terrorist group or individual terrorists,' an alliance that 'could allow the Iraqi regime to attack America without leaving any fingerprints.'   In each of these charges, Bush omitted qualifiers that make the accusations seem less convincing. In the case of the al Qaeda leader receiving medical treatment, U.S. intelligence officials acknowledged that the terrorist, Abu Musab Zarqawi, was no longer in Iraq and that there was no hard evidence Hussein's government knew he was there or had contact with him. On the matter of the aircraft, a CIA report this month suggested that the fleet was more of an 'experiment' and 'attempt' and labeled it a 'serious threat to Iraq's neighbors and to international military forces in the region' -- but said nothing about it having sufficient range to threaten the United States.  Bush's statement about the Iraqi nuclear defector, implying such information was current in 1998, was a reference to Khidhir Hamza. But Hamza, though he spoke publicly about his information in 1998, retired from Iraq's nuclear program in 1991, fled to the Iraqi north in 1994 and left the country in 1995. Finally, Bush's statement that Iraq could attack 'on any given day' with terrorist groups was at odds with congressional testimony by the CIA. The testimony, declassified after Bush's speech, rated the possibility as 'low' that Hussein would initiate a chemical or biological weapons attack against the United States but might take the 'extreme step' of assisting terrorists if provoked by a U.S. attack.  White House spokesmen said in response that it was 'unrealistic' to assume Iraqi authorities did not know of Zarqawi's presence and that Iraq's unmanned aircraft could be launched from ships or trucks outside Iraq.   Some of the disputed Bush assertions are matters of perspective.  Bush often says, as he did Friday in Missouri, that 'because of a quirk in the rules in the United States Senate, after a 10-year period, the tax-relief plan we passed goes away.' There is a Senate rule that required a 60-vote majority for the tax cut, but the decision to let the cuts expire was based on pragmatic considerations. Proponents of the cut from the House and Senate -- both under GOP control at the time -- decided to have the tax cut expire after nine years to keep its price tag within the $1.35 trillion over 10 years that had been agreed between lawmakers and Bush.  Other times, the president's assertions simply outpace the facts. In New Hampshire earlier this month, he said his education legislation made 'the biggest increase in education spending in a long, long time.'   In fact, the 15.8 percent increase in Department of Education discretionary spending for fiscal year 2002 (the figures the White House supplied when asked about Bush's statement) was below the 18.5 percent increase under Clinton the previous year -- and Bush had wanted a much smaller increase than Congress approved. Earlier this month, Republican moderates complained to Bush's budget director, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., that the administration was not spending the full amount for education that Congress approved. Daniels said it was 'nothing uncommon' and decried the 'explosively larger education bill.'    2002 The Washington Post Company           "

"528",528,589736,"Aries","           I would counter that there is now a precedent for federal court intervention in federal elections and that there is a constitutional basis for it. the supreme court did not choose bush over gore as much as it made florida clearly define what their election process is and whether the process itself violated federal law. from bush vs. gore  urlLink http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=531&invol=98   The petition presents the following questions: whether the Florida Supreme Court established new standards for resolving Presidential election contests, thereby violating Art. II, 1, cl. 2, of the United States Constitution and failing to comply with 3 U. S. C. 5, and whether the use of standardless manual recounts violates the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses. With respect to the equal protection question, we find a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  The Florida Supreme Court has ordered that the intent of the voter be discerned from such ballots. For purposes of resolving the equal protection challenge, it is not necessary to decide whether the Florida Supreme Court had the authority under the legislative scheme for resolving election disputes to define what a legal vote is and to mandate a manual recount implementing that definition. The recount mechanisms implemented in response to the decisions of the Florida Supreme Court do not satisfy the minimum requirement for non-arbitrary treatment of voters necessary to secure the fundamental right. Florida's basic command forthe count of legally cast votes is to consider the 'intent of the voter.' Gore v. Harris, ___ So. 2d, at ___ (slip op., at 39). This is unobjectionable as an abstract proposition and a starting principle. The problem inheres in the absence of specific standards to ensure its equal application. The formulation of uniform rules to determine intent based on these recurring circumstances is practicable and, we conclude, necessary.  While I understand Ted Rall's frustration with having Bush as president, I do not agree that the election was a judicial coup d'etat.  What it was though is an example, notedin the supreme court ruling itself, that the vote counting systems in this country are antiquated and need to be changed and standardized so everyone's vote can be counted. Florida was having different counties determine what was and was not a 'hanging chad'.  how can this be considered equal protection for all state voters wheneach district has it's own standards about what constitutes a vote?  and jimi, this case in front of the supreme court was brought by bush not by gore.           "
"529",529,589736,"Aries","           Let's get the record straight about the 2000 Election.  After each recount Bush still won in Florida.  I believe there were 3 recounts: a machine recount, and 2 hand recounts.  At the conclusion of each one, the Gore team (not Bush) cried foul and appealed to the higher courts.  It was the Gore team that tried and succeded in a lot of cases to have military absentee votes invalidated because of technicalities.  And they cheered when the decision by the court was returned in their favor!  Can you believe that?!  A candidate who consistently said he wanted 'to be sure that each vote was counted' had his attourneys in court cheering when they discredited the validity of the votes of men and women serving their country!  What a 'man' Gore is!     Next, there  is  federal election law provided in the Constitution.  The Constitution provides the boundaries for electing the President by the electors of the Electoral College.  Check out this web site for more info:   http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/refarticle.aspx?refid=761576768               'The electoral system was devised by the drafters of the Constitution of the United States, who hoped thereby to entrust the responsibility to people whose choice would be unaffected by partisan politics. In Article II, Section 1, of the Constitution, the method of selecting electors is delegated to the separate state legislatures, and the voting procedure to be followed by the electors is carefully defined. According to the electoral procedure originally specified in the Constitution, the electors were to vote for the two most qualified persons without specifying which was preferred for president and which for vice president. The candidate receiving the greatest number of electoral votes, provided the votes of a majority of the electors were received, would be president, and the candidate winning the second largest number of votes would be vice president. A serious flaw in this procedure was revealed in the election of 1800, when Thomas Jefferson was the presidential candidate of the Democratic-Republican Party (the forerunner of todays Democratic Party) and Aaron Burr was the candidate for vice president. The electors, by voting strictly for candidates of their party, gave Burr and Jefferson the same number of votes. As the Constitution provided, the election was referred to the House of Representatives, where a protracted struggle took place, requiring 36 ballots before Jefferson was chosen president and Burr vice president. Therefore, in 1804 Congress enacted and the states ratified the 12th Amendment, providing for separate electoral votes for president and for vice president.'   As you see in the article, the selecting of electors is left to the states' legislatures, but the election of a President is outlined in the Constitution.  Ben, the author of your article didn't do his homework.  The election of Bush to office according to the Constitution is fully legit.  Sorry, Democrats!   As far as the Toricelli case, Representatives and Senators are elected according to individual laws of the states.  So I can understand why the Supreme Court refused to hear the case.         "
"530",530,589736,"Aries","           A stay would be 'the only means of protecting the integrity of the federal election process,' Republicans argued. But that's exactly the point: there is no 'federal election process.' Elections, even for national office, are governed by state law and administered by state bureaucrats. The highest arbiter of election disputes is each state's supreme court.  The 2000 Florida dispute resulted in Republicans--historically the great champions of states' rights--obtaining the help of the federal court system to subvert the states' constitutionally-protected control of elections. An appeal of the Florida Supreme Court's decision, no matter how flawed that decision may have been, violated the Constitution. The fact that Renhquist et al. agreed to hear Bush v. Gore is what makes Bush's regime illegal. Had the court installed Gore rather than Bush, Gore would be the usurper. Recounts, hanging chads, choosing Bush over Gore--those details are mere footnotes to a brazenly extrajurisdictional judicial coup d'tat.  A Republican-controlled U.S. Supreme Court broke the law on behalf of George W. Bush. Would they do it for Douglas Forrester? 'The elites beat up on the Supreme Court very severely for Bush v. Gore,' commented conservative George Mason University professor Dan Polsby. 'I'm sure they don't relish being beat up by those elites again.' On Oct. 7 the Supremes did what they ought to have done two years ago in the Florida case--they refused to hear the case, without comment.  Election disputes, after all, are resolved by each state's supreme court.    urlLink - Ted Rall,  The Ironic Implication of the New Jersey Imbroglio           "

"565",565,589736,"Aries","           the new 'state-of-the-arf' shelter - this makes me proud to be a richmonder  The Cat's Pajamas  Richmond SPCA Opens Its Deluxe Animal Shelter   By Don Oldenburg Washington Post Staff Writer Tuesday, November 26, 2002; Page C01    RICHMOND  When you walk into the Richmond SPCA's Robins-Starr Humane Center -- an animal shelter -- instead of hearing pained howls and barks, you get soothing strains of Mozart or New Age music. Instead of the stench of hapless animals, the air smells outdoor fresh. Instead of depressed dogs and cats killing time in cramped cages, these potential pets are bright-eyed and ready to go in their 'living rooms.'  With its stylish interior painted bold yellows, blue-violets and mauves, the new 'state-of-the-arf' shelter, which opened last month, looks more like a fancy hotel. Natural light pours down from huge skylights. Bronze sculptures and paintings lend the feel of an art gallery. And the canine living rooms and cat cotillions are unmistakenly homelike.  'Oh, my gosh!' says first-time visitor Katherine Gregory, from South Riding in Loudoun County. In Richmond visiting her mother, Gregory stopped by the center with her sons, Andrew, 10, and Matthew, 7, in search of a kitten. 'I'm amazed. I recently went to the Loudoun shelter and the Fairfax shelter, and they aren't anything like this!'  Pound for pound, this 64,000-square-foot center -- currently housing about two-thirds of its capacity, which is 150 dogs and 150 cats -- is not like any animal shelter you've ever seen. The facility, located in a warehouse district off the Boulevard exit from Interstate 95, is among the largest nationwide. But size isn't everything: The center was designed to defy preconceptions, the theory being that a cheery environment will foster a higher rate of adoption.  That's critical, since the motive for this $7.2 million shelter was the Richmond SPCA's decision to 'go no-kill.' The group is also committed to making the whole city no-kill by 2008.  'What keeps people from walking in the door of a shelter? It's noisy, it's depressing, it's scary, it's smelly,' says Denise Deisler, the Richmond SPCA's associate executive director. 'This place is bright and friendly.'  The building is a 78-year-old red-brick tobacco warehouse with a verdigris seamed roof. Beyond the lobby are 11 glass-doored 'dog living rooms.' About the size of a small bedroom, each is furnished with a stylish blue metal bench and chairs and a puffy dog bed. A large Labrador-mix named Old Bay sits eagerly at the door of one. On his windowsill is this personal publicity: a can of Old Bay Seasoning and a note, 'I like lots of love and need to take long walks on the beach.'   'They will allow you to go in these rooms and actually sit with the dog, and play with the dog, get to know the dog, walk the dog outside,' says Tony Zimmer, the contractor who oversaw the renovation but kept returning after it was done.  A 'lifelong dog person,' Zimmer says he kept coming back because the people, the place and the pets left him feeling good. 'It's not like looking at dogs in cages. You actually get to know the dog.' A couple weeks ago, he took home a 4-month-old red chow.  The public can also visit dogs in the less flashy kennel rooms. The 22 'kennel runs,' each four feet wide and 14 feet long, are significantly larger than standard shelter cages.  At the opposite end of the shelter are the individual cat 'condos' and three cat 'cotillions' -- large rooms with open drawers, cubbyholes and climbing poles, where as many as 10 cats live and people can visit.  All details are designed to bring out the best in the animals. The floors are soft, waterproof epoxy-finished surfaces and the ceilings are sound-absorbent. The cacophony typical of kennels not only is unpleasant for people but also hurts the animals (dogs can hear frequencies more than 20 kHz higher than humans; cats, more than 45 kHz higher).  'When a dog is in pain from the sound, that elevates the stress level,' says Emerson Hughes, owner of Holiday Barn Pet Resorts and former chairman of the Richmond SPCA board, who oversaw the project.  Although the creature comforts are as much for visitors, Deisler says Mozart really does soothe the savage beast -- or confused puppy. In a study conducted at Queen's University in Belfast, psychologists found that heavy-metal music increased anxiety in dogs and caused barking, while classical music alleviated stress and quieted barking.  The shelter's classical music is digitally altered to put a damper on the ultrahigh and low frequencies. 'If they are too stressed out, that reduces their immune system and that leads to them being sick, and if they are sick we can't adopt them,' says Deisler.  But what an adoring public sees and hears in the adoption area is just a small part of the center. Only about a quarter of the animals are available for adoption at any one time. The rest are being rehabbed.  Behind the scenes, every animal gets a physical and behavioral checkup. Dogs with contagious diseases -- like Raspie, a 4-year-old Sheltie with kennel cough -- are confined to the Physical Rehab Room for treatment. Staff experts work with personality problems in the Behavioral Rehab Room. Even healthy animals get a three-day adjustment period to acclimate to shelter life.  Zephia Scarborough adopted a black-and-white kitten she named Steinway a few weeks ago. Because he had been trapped inside a wall for several days before being rescued, the kitten was traumatized. Before taking Steinway home, she had to wait for him to come out of rehab. 'Ten days later, he was fat and happy and purring,' the Richmond resident says.  Also hidden are the shelter's command centers for its centrally controlled, high-pressure hydro-cleaning system that borrows from car wash technology, and its advanced air-exchange system that sends fresh air throughout the building every six minutes. 'It's good for reducing the spread of disease and the odors in the building, and it has the side benefit of not collecting as much dust and hairballs,' says Deisler.  Near the entrance is the spay-neuter clinic. Each year, 18,000 'companion animals' end up here or in one of the city or county shelters in the greater Richmond area; in the past, half of those animals were euthanized. Now the center spays or neuters every animal when it arrives and offers those services at low cost to the public.  Pet overpopulation is a nationwide problem, of course. Accurate numbers aren't available, but the Humane Society of the United States estimates that 8 million to 10 million dogs and cats enter U.S. shelters each year and that half are euthanized. Locally, the Montgomery County Humane Society shelter, the only one in the county, took in 6,650 dogs and cats in the year that ended in July and euthanized about 2,600. The D.C. Animal Shelter took in 9,284 and euthanized 65 percent of them.  Deisler mentions a statistic. How many dogs and cats would every person in the United States have to own to empty all of the shelters? 'It just blew my mind,' she says. 'Six cats and two dogs.'  On the second floor is a 'humane library,' a large auditorium that seats 300 people for educational programs and benefit events, and a spectacular rubber-padded jogging track and training arena where all dogs are exercised and obedience classes are held.  'Part of making this community no-kill is you've got to provide good educational programs for people to understand how to do it,' says Robin Robertson Starr, executive director of the facility, who expects the center to help 6,000 to 8,000 animals get adopted annually -- twice as many as the old shelter.  At the forefront of a revolution in the pet care industry, the Richmond center is attracting international attention. Since opening, it has received 250 job and volunteer applications. (Besides 150 volunteers, it employs 50 kennel workers and staffers whose annual salaries range from $20,000 to $36,000.) People from other SPCAs nationwide call for tours. Starr has participated in an 'international chat' online and a conference in Atlanta. The Mayor's Alliance for Animals in New York has contacted the Richmond SPCA about how it is working with the city to solve the animal overpopulation problem.  The center's no-kill policy means it does not kill animals due to overpopulation. It takes in only animals that it can physically and behaviorally rehabilitate to an adoptable condition. All animals at the shelter stay there until they are adopted. 'We control admissions so as never to exceed our capacity,' says Starr.  Even private kennels are upgrading facilities in what the American Pet Products and Manufacturing Association calls a $31 billion industry: This month, Olde Towne Pet Resort opened in Springfield. Billing itself as 'The Ultimate Pet Care Facility,' it offers services such as an indoor hydrotherapy pool and an indoor walking track and agility course.  'It's more than just the building, it's the no-kill policy. No-kill is the real trend toward significant change,' says Starr, after whom the center was named, along with patron E. Claiborne Robins Jr. In the first 10 months of this year, 1,200 fewer animals were euthanized by the Richmond SPCA than in the same period the year before.  Some of the interest is in how the Richmond SPCA raised $14.2 million in three years during an economic downturn. Half of that went to build and half to operate; the operating budget, derived from donations, is $2.5 million a year, twice that of the old shelter.  'You work really hard,' says Starr, an attorney who worked full time those three years raising donations -- nearly all of them coming from the Richmond community.  Outside her second-floor office, playing with her own 3-year-old shaggy mutt named Nibblet, one of the four dogs and two cats she has adopted, Starr says people 'care a lot about the humane cause, but people don't care a lot about continuing to throw their money at something that never changes.'  What worked in Richmond, she explains, 'was presenting them with a problem that can be licked, telling them how it can be licked.'  But whenever an animal shelter upgrades beyond concrete floors and clanky cages, Starr says, someone always questions treating animals so well when homeless people are sleeping on the streets.  'I have trouble with that comparison,' she says. 'If we wanted to say that human homelessness is the cause that matters the most, then that could also be said of the money that goes to art museums, or the money that goes to botanical gardens, or the performing arts.  'All of those are valuable things that improve the quality of our lives. So do pets. They enormously improve the quality of our lives.'           "

We went in for a routine check, and the doctor saw something she did not like and sent Julie down for observation.  Come to find out, she was having contractions and did not even notice them.  She is only 26 weeks, so no one wants to see these babies born yet.  They gave Julie some medicine that did not stop the contractions.  They then tried a different, stronger, medicine, and it did not work either.  By 5 o'clock, her very reserved doctor, was visibly concerned about the situation.  Finally, around 7, the contractions slowed. and have, as of an hour ago, stopped.  Julie will be in the hospital through at least tomorrow, depending on how she reacts to being weened off the medication.  After that though, she will be on mandatory bedrest.

In one last-minute addition, Representative Dick Armey, Republican of Texas, inserted a provision that was apparently intended to protect Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical giant, from lawsuits over thimerosal, a mercury-based vaccine preservative that some parents contend has caused autism in their children.  full article from the ny times :   House Approves Domestic Security Bill By DAVID FIRESTONE  ASHINGTON, Nov. 13  The House hurriedly approved a revised domestic security bill tonight to reflect a new agreement with the White House on reducing worker protections, brushing aside Democratic objections that Republican leaders had added several provisions benefiting businesses and Republican interests.  The bill, approved 299 to 121, would reverse an earlier measure and allow American companies that have moved offshore in order to evade taxes to contract with the Homeland Security Department. It would also extend protection against liability suits for airline screening companies and many other businesses that contract with the department, and adds a similar provision protecting the makers of smallpox vaccines.  Most Democrats voted against the bill, with many raising objections to the new provisions and the altering of Civil Service rules.  The House voted 215 to 203 along party lines not to create an independent commission to investigate the Sept. 11 attacks. Several members of both parties in the two chambers said they would try to include the commission in an intelligence spending bill that has still not been passed. But Republican House leaders said the commission needed more planning, drawing complaints from relatives of attack victims that they were trying to hide failures that might have prevented the attacks.  Working to conclude the year's legislative business by week's end, the House also passed a stopgap spending measure to keep the government operating through January. Many members of both parties had hoped the House would pass at least a few of the pending appropriations bills the government uses to keep operating, but House leaders said they would take up the bills once the new Congress convened next year.  As expected, Republican House members elected Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, formerly the majority whip, to the new post of majority leader in the next session.   Democratic House members are scheduled to conduct their leadership elections on Thursday, and are likely to choose Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, now the minority whip, as their leader.  This morning, however, a new candidate for the job emerged, demonstrating the continuing disagreements among Democrats over how to respond to their losses in last week's elections. Representative Marcy Kaptur of Ohio said she would run for the position to draw votes from members who object to Ms. Pelosi's emphasis on fund-raising.  'We will never raise more money than the Republicans  never,' said Ms. Kaptur, who is known for her opposition to free-trade measures and federal funding for abortions. 'We must elevate the non-money wing of the Democratic Party and create populist symbols to convey our message.'  Ms. Kaptur joins Harold E. Ford Jr. of Tennessee in contesting the Democratic leadership election, for which Ms. Pelosi claims to already have sufficient support to win.  In the Senate, Republicans chose Trent Lott of Mississippi to be the majority leader in the next term, along with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky as majority whip and Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona in the third-ranking job of leading the Republican Policy Committee. Mr. Lott said after today's election that Republicans would focus on national and economic security, mentioning specifically a prescription drug program for low-income older people and making individual retirement accounts easier to use.  Senate Democrats also held their leadership elections today, unanimously choosing Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota as chairman of the caucus, along with Senators Harry Reid of Nevada and Barbara A. Mikulski of Maryland in the No. 2 and No. 3 positions. Mr. Daschle will be minority leader in the next Senate, Mr. Reid will be minority whip.  Senators also voted 58 to 36 not to block their annual pay raise, which would increase their salaries by 3.1 percent to $154,700 to $150,000 next year. Passage of an energy bill was deferred until next year because of continuing partisan disagreements over regulation and conservation.  The Senate began a lengthier process of approving the domestic security bill, which is expected to pass as early as Friday.  Senators showed that they remained closely divided on the bill, deciding 50 to 47 to drop the Democratic version of the bill on a closely watched test vote. The new version of the bill will have enough votes for passage, but many Democrats remain upset that President Bush won virtually his entire plan to cut back on civil service protections for workers, making it easier to fire and transfer them.  Many Democrats in both chambers were furious today when they read the fine print of the new version of the bill and found that Republicans had inserted provisions that had not been discussed in the six months of debate on the antiterrorism department, or that had been cut in the Senate bill.  The new language, for example, allows the administration to reorganize the department after it is created, differing from the Senate Republican version that would require congressional approval of a reorganization. It revises a provision, passed 318 to 110 in July, that prohibited contracts with offshore tax-evading companies, allowing the department to waive the ban in the name of saving American jobs.  The bill would allow immunity from liability for companies that make faulty antiterrorism devices or technology, and would make it difficult to sue companies that make smallpox vaccinations if the vaccines cause illness.  In one last-minute addition, Representative Dick Armey, Republican of Texas, inserted a provision that was apparently intended to protect Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical giant, from lawsuits over thimerosal, a mercury-based vaccine preservative that some parents contend has caused autism in their children.  'I'm really quite surprised they would put in the fine-print provisions we never saw in any other versions, that never even went through committees,' said Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee.'  But Republicans, like Representative William M. Thornberry of Texas, said the additions were minor and paled next to the importance of creating a department to protect the nation's safety.               "

"635",635,589736,"Aries","             Tori Amos Scarlet's Walk  (Epic)  Tori Amos is one of America's most polarizing artists, with each album predictably regarded as a love-it-or-hate-it proposition sure to thrill every fan and aggravate every hater. But she's made good and bad records just like anyone else: For proof, listen to her sublime From The Choirgirl Hotel and her horrid covers album Strange Little Girls back to back. Amos' well-documented idiosyncrasies tend to be reflected in teeth-gnashingly twee flights of fancy just as often as they produce bracing catharsis, making her catalog both rewarding and punishing when taken as a whole. Come to think of it, that just about sums up Scarlet's Walk, her epic follow-up to Strange Little Girls. A characteristically oblique concept album about finding the soul of America in its open roads, the disc marks a vast leap beyond its more gimmicky predecessor. From the pretty ballad 'Your Cloud' to the irresistibly poppy single 'A Sorta Fairytale,' Scarlet's Walk moves through some remarkable terrain. But amid all the elegantly sweeping, minor-key arrangements are the usual aggravating moments, most notably at the end of songs like 'Mrs. Jesus' (yeech) and 'Wednesday,' which each close with a breathless solo a cappella vocal for dramatic effect. The result tends to highlight lines that don't serve her well: Try not to groan when Amos stops the music on 'Wednesday' long enough to wheeze, 'Lost in a place called America.' But on Scarlet's Walk, her audacity is just as often admirable, and the album represents a considerable step up for fans and foes alike.

"643",643,589736,"Aries","           A quick note, kids: Life has a funny way of working out (to paraphrase Alanis), and the irony of it all is a balm to sooth even the deepest hurts. For those of you who don't know, I spent seven long, dark, dismal months looking for a job. For those of you unfortunate enough to have lived through an extended period of unplanned joblessness, you know the drill. Darkness. Dispair. etc., ad nasuem, without end. I finally landed one in October, and was happy to begin the long process of rebuilding my work self-esteem. It's a job, even if it is a contract job. Even if the contract ends 31 December. It's a job. With a paycheck. I am happy.  So it was with the most wonderful sense of irony and wonderment at how Life can sometimes work out that I found myself yesterday driving a candy apple red Camero convertable down the Nimitz Highway toward my hotel on Waikiki Beach on a sunny Saturday afternoon. Honolulu for New Year's Eve. Yes, kids, through no effort of my own, I made a withdrawal from my burgeoning account at the Karma Bank.  And the icing: the per diem rate here is $78 a day.  If someone has a place to post them, I'll send pictures of Pearl Harbor when I go.  Happy New Year to all.   P.S.

Fabulous visuals.  A shame the story is veering from Tolkien now not only in terms of tone, but now of plot.  Note that the former issue (different tone) was my only complaint re: FotR.  Though I suspected slippage might kick in somewhere in the second movie.  I still maintain that Tolkien wrote a mythology, a history, and a travelogue, with heroic elements -- *not* an adventure story.  Which is what Jackson appears to have decided to film.  Which begs the question:  is this a book, or a film?  Clearly a film -- and as such, while it is a similar animal, it is truly another species than a book, with its own rules and expectations.  To put people in the seats, you don't film a book -- you pull the film out of the book, even if you have to alter it  to do so.  One can film a book, and do it beautifully -- but you better resign yourself to the art circuit.  We'll be glad to see you, but we ain't gonna give you box office.         "

"660",660,589736,"Aries","           For those that have not seen Two Towers yet, read carefully.  Nothing I consider a spoiler, but you may disagree.  As a Tolkien purist, I have several complaints.  As a movie fan, not so many, but, lord help you if you have not read the books or sat next to someone who could explain the finer points that are glossed over.  My biggest complaint is the fact that because they expanded on the Battle of Helm's Deep greatly (1/3 of the movie revolves around it - where it was one chapter out of about 12 in the first half of the book) and that they added the romance between Aragorn and Arwen plus a skirmish between the Rohan and Warg riding Goblins, they really only got through about 2/3 of the book.  Given the amount of fighting left to be shown in Return of the King, you can see that they will cut out several parts of the story.  Because of some of the modifications already seen, it does not appear that Aragorn will take the Path of Dead and bring the naval fleet up to break the siege.  They will also probably not address what becomes of Saruman and what happens to the Shire.  The greatly enhanced roles of Merry and Pippin (with Rohan and Gondor) do not appear to be occuring either.  Who will kill the Witch King?  I also think the tried to hard to set up the sequel.  The emphasis on Gollum's discussion of 'she' in regards to getting the Ring are totally transparent to those who have read the books, but not really sold well if you have not.All said and done, I enjoyed the movie, and intend to see it again (hopefully with Mr. Haley when he is back among the living), but am disappointed with the lack of trueness compared to FotR.  BTW, New Zealand is indeed a beautiful country.  I never would have thought they had the terrain and vistas they do.         "

"663",663,589736,"Aries","           Having grown up in Mississippi, I can say with some certainty that I agree with my future husband about his assessment of Lott.  He is intelligent and charismatic -- and ignorant as Mississippi Mud.  And I believe he, like many whites (and blacks, for that matter) from the Deep South, have latent issues with racism.  But I also agree that it's a social, not political issue.  Mississippi & Alabama really are almost different worlds from what goes on closer to the Mason-Dixon.  I had never seen such unconscious segregation until I moved there.  I am very happy to be further north now.  Remember also, Chris...that while Lott was attempting (poor thing) to cover his ass on BET (once again, having grown up in MS...BAAAAAHAAAAA!  you have no idea how funny THAT was for me)....he was asked why he voted against making MLK day a national holiday...and he responded by saying (this was voted on in 1983 or so, mind you) something to the effect of having not realized MLK's social-political-historical significance at the time.  What a jackass.  As for his future in the Senate, I don't really shive a git.  I don't live in MS anymore and am no longer directly affected by his decisions.  If government is what it was built to be, i. e. an accurate representation of its constituents, then Lott is a perfect representative for Mississippi and its beliefs.  So there ya go. I'm done.          "
"664",664,589736,"Aries","           chris, i compared strom thurmond to adolf hitler, not trent lott. actually, i wasn't really comparing hitler to anyone in particular; i was showing an example of how a person can say something that is not overtly racist but could easily be perceived that way.    i agree for the most part with everything that jls said.  this controversy about trent lott really is just a form of misdirection:  so we aren't discussing real problems and coming up with solid and practical solutions.    and like i said in my post, i knew it was an extreme example - it was mostly for fun.         "
"665",665,589736,"Aries","           It seems to me that neither Republicans nor Democrats ever really discuss what I would call politics.  For the record, I do not define the Lott issue as politics.  It's more like idle parlor talk.  Ideological masturbation.  I see no social or economic problem to solve by applying governmental political theory.  To me, it means nothing politically.  Emotionally, sure -- I can see it on that level.  Sociologically, certainly -- race is a fine subject for sociological study.  But politics?  I just don't see any point worth making on either ideological side.  Note that this is only only my opinion.  However, in the interests of idle parlor talk, I will toss this in the ring:  I perceive two kinds of racism.  First, conscious racism.  This is proactive, goal-oriented.  Extreme examples include hunting someone down and killing them, or burning crosses in yards.  It's fairly easy to spot, if only for its focused malignancy.  The second kind is similar in theme, yet very different.  I'll call it, for lack of a better term, unconscious racism.  Here, the person does not seek the destruction or expulsion of the group; he or she just sort of doesn't think about them much.  In fact, there isn't much thought at all.  This describes most of my immediate ancestors.  My grandmother, for example, would talk of 'colored' people in a way that meant no harm, but something in the tone suggested she unconsciously judged them by race.  There was no desire to actively seek out the race and destroy it; she was just -- well -- for lack of a better word -- naive and ignorant.  This does not make it right, but it is an important distinction.  Because in terms of Trent Lott, I have never perceived him as consciously, actively racist.  However, I have followed various biographies of him over the years, and heard him talk, and I have always felt comfortable that he fits well in the second category.  Not that he uses the word 'colored,' perhaps -- but there is a certain...well, naivete and ignorance in his words.  Case in point:  the birthday speech.  It seems to me that the words he chose revealed that mindless (rather than mindful) naivete and ignorance often exhibited by those who really haven't given the matter all that much thought.  This is not to say he is unintelligent, or evil, or good -- it's just an observation of his person.  Note that this is not observation of his *character*, which, for me, would not come into play unless he was in the first category, that of the conscious, ill-willed racist.  It seems to me that this is a man who isn't entirely on the ball about the whole race issue, and revealed his ambiguity (ambivalence?) through a naive and ignorant choice of words at the wrong time.  I do not condone what he said, nor do I praise it.  Ultimately it had absolutely no immediate impact on me.  I just watched the clip and thought 'Huh.  What an unfortunate place to utter such poorly thought-out words.'  All that said, to return to my original point -- it seems to me that so much more could be accomplished in this country if both Republicans and Democrats spent less time yammering on with all this ideological parlor talk and intellectual posturing, and focused all that mental energy on applying the broad range of available political philosophies to the immediate, tangible social, economic, and international issues that we as a society, a government, and a country would do well to confront.  There are real problems all around us.  Let's butt heads in a dialogue that matters, and work towards solutions that piss off all ideological sides just enough to the point that we're as close to the Truth as we can get.  I mean, come on, citizens.  Surely we're smarter than this.         "
"666",666,589736,"Aries","           Oh, Mir -- it's nice to see that things haven't changed!  As offended as you might be because Lott stepped up at the birthday party of a man who has lived ONE HUNDRED YEARS and said something vaguely nice about his past, I am 300% MORE offended that you have just compared Trent Lott to Adolf Hitler. There're extreme examples and then there are examples that are so extreme as to make them irrelevant. Exhibit A, your response below.  Once my breathing exercises kicked in, I was able to conjure up a response. Here's a counter-example that is a little closer to home: It's Ben's 60th birthday party. We're all gathered around, munching on fried tofu strips and organic vegetables. I raise my glass to my old friend. 'Ben,' I say, 'you've lived a long and fruitful life. We have all watched with a little envy as you have lived a life imagined and been true to yourself. Now, I was sure that Leslie would turn out to be your one true love, and if you'd snapped her up before she turned legal, your life would have certainly turned out differently. You might even have had enough money to afford to retire by now, instead of mooching off us for so long.' [cue polite laugher from the crowd]   Does this mean that I am advocating a romatic relationship between a 28-year-old adult and a 16-year-old minor? Am I coming out in favor of statutory rape? Hardly. What I am doing is speaking some comforting words to a dear friend of mine, trying to get him to reminisce about days gone by and success won and lost. Now, I am deliberately choosing a less extreme example. Segregation is wrong. Slavery is evil. There is no defending the southern white politicians or the white mobs of the 50s and 60s. But Trent Lott was toasting an old man at his BIRTHDAY PARTY, praising his past efforts, trying to make said old man think back on his life and feel content. Instead of a nice comment on an old man's accomplishments, this has exploded into a racial issue -- and the press has been pumping the bellows and tossing the gasoline cans with reckless abandon for 10 days.  Read the direct quote: '''I want to say this about my state,' Lott said at the party. ''When Strom Thurmond ran for president, we voted for him. We're proud of it. And if the rest of the country had followed our lead, we wouldn't have had all these problems over all these years either.''' (Washington Post, 7 Dec 02)  Where in that statement does Lott praise segregation? Where is the racist in the white sheet? Where does he say that the country would be better if we shipped all those dirty negroes back to Africa? Hell, the man didn't even once say 'segregation' -- much less say that the overtly segregationist policies of the Dixiecrat party were right and good and embodied all that made America great. But you wouldn't guess that reading the news stories today....  Now, here's what the press has been reporting for the past two weeks [emphasis added]: 'Senate Republican leader Trent Lott (Miss.) last night apologized for suggesting that the country would have been better off if  segregationist candidate  Strom Thurmond had been elected president in 1948.' (Washington Post, 10 Dec 02); 'Faced with an uproar over his remark that the nation would have been better off if Strom Thurmond had won the presidency  when he ran on a segregationist ticket  in 1948, Senate Republican leader Trent Lott apologized Monday night, saying he misspoke.' (USA Today, 10 Dec 02); 'Republicans are trying to regroup from the uproar caused by the  segregation statement  by Lott, of Mississippi, at an event marking South Carolina Sen. Thurmond's 100th birthday.' (Reuters, 15 Dec 02); '...Lott said Mississippians were proud to have voted for the  one-time segregationist  when he sought the White House.' (AP, 16 Dec 02); '...when Lott  praised the South Carolina Republican's segregationist run for president  in 1948.' (Boston Globe, 19 Dec 02).   And my personal favorite: 'Gore, speaking on CNN's 'Inside Politics,' said the Senate should censure Lott. 'It is not a small thing for one of the half-dozen most prominent political leaders in America to say that our problems are caused by integration and that we should have had a segregationist candidate,' he said. 'That is divisive, and it is divisive along racial lines.'' (AP, 7 Dec 02)  WHERE DID LOTT SAY THAT INTEGRATION CAUSED OUR PROBLEMS????????  What we have here is not a suddenly outed racist. What we have is a feeding frenzy, started by Democrats still stinging from the thorough trouncing they received in the mid-term elections and facilitated, even egged on, by a decidedly liberal press that has already convicted a man of racism. Yet again, I am disgusted by the blatant leftward leaning of our nation's media....          "
"667",667,589736,"Aries","           all right, john - i'll use an extreme example but they are always the most fun :) let's say, for whatever reason, that hitler had immigrated to america, and soon all of his nazi past was pretty much forgotten, he had been elected to the senate by the fine state of south carolina multiple times, and hell, he even had some jews on his staff. okay, it's hitler's 100th birthday.  trett lott gets up and says 'you know adolf, things would have been very different if you would have won world war II, we could have avoided alot of the problems we have now.' now you could assume that trett lott was referring to the autobahn, the volkswagon, the revived german economy, the growth of industry, but you know, no matter how you look at it, you can't get past the idea that one of hitler's main objectives in world war II was to kill all the jews.   some people would find it offensive that trent lott would even conceive that the idea of oppressing/killing a group of people as part of your political platform would be appropriate.   i think that's why people are offended about his comments to strom thurmond.

"668",668,589736,"Aries","           Ok.  I'll bite.  For the sake of this argument, let's say that Trent Lott DIRECTLY said he was in favor of segregation and all the other race garbage from the South of 50 years ago.  Bottom line, he is entitled to his opinion, politically correct or not.  The last I checked, the First Amendment was still in force.  Why does he have to resign his post?  If the Republicans want him as their leader, that is their choice.  Keep in mind that, according to a black radio show host I saw on TV the other day (Tom Joyner?), 98% of the black vote in this country goes to the Democrats.  Odds are, the voters who would vote based on only the issue of Civil Rights, already voted for the Democrats because of the perception (wrong in my opinion) that the Democrats are more dedicated to that issue.  So, what damage is there to be done by taking the black vote away?  Politically, none.         "

The efforts would thrust the administration into a debate that until now has lingered on the fringes of economic policy: Are too few wealthy Americans paying too much in taxes for too many, and should the working poor and middle class be shouldering more of the tax burden?   New Tax Plan May Bring Shift In Burden  Poor Could Pay A Bigger Share     By Jonathan Weisman Washington Post Staff Writer Monday, December 16, 2002; Page A03    As the Bush administration draws up plans to simplify the tax system, it is also refining arguments for why it may be necessary to shift more of the tax load onto lower-income workers.  Economists at the Treasury Department are drafting new ways to calculate the distribution of tax burdens among different income classes, which are expected to highlight what administration officials see as a rising tax burden on the rich and a declining burden on the poor. The White House Council of Economic Advisers is also preparing a report detailing the concentration of the tax burden on the affluent and highlighting problems with the way tax burdens are calculated for the poor.  The efforts would thrust the administration into a debate that until now has lingered on the fringes of economic policy: Are too few wealthy Americans paying too much in taxes for too many, and should the working poor and middle class be shouldering more of the tax burden?  'The increasing reliance on taxing higher-income households and targeted social preferences at lower incomes stands in the way of moving to a simpler, flatter tax system,' R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, warned at a tax forum at the American Enterprise Institute on Tuesday.  The Council of Economic Advisers' 'Economic Report to the President,' scheduled for release late next month or in early February, is to include a section arguing for new methods to calculate the distribution of tax burdens on various income groups.   The Treasury Department is working up more sophisticated distribution tables that are expected to make the poor appear to be paying less in taxes and the rich to be paying more.  Answering critics who say the working poor do face high taxes because they pay high Social Security payroll taxes, outgoing White House economic adviser Lawrence B. Lindsey told the AEI tax forum that the 12.4 percent Social Security levy should not be considered when tax burdens are calculated. Lindsey said the Social Security tax is ultimately returned to the taxpayer as a benefit.   Lindsey compared the Social Security tax to a deposit in a neighborhood bank's Christmas Club. In such clubs, periodic deposits are returned in a lump sum during the holiday season, and Lindsey said no one would consider such deposits a tax.  Early this month, J.T. Young, the deputy assistant treasury secretary for legislative affairs, lamented in a Washington Times opinion article: '[Higher] earners cannot produce the level of revenues needed to sustain the liberals' increasingly costly spending programs over the long-term. . . . If federal government spending is not controlled, then the tax burden will have to begin extending backward down the income ladder.'  The tenor of the administration's policy discussions marks a dramatic shift from early in 2001, when Bush sold his 10-year, $1.35 trillion tax cut as a tool to 'take down the tollgate on the road to the middle class,' emphasizing its beneficial impact on workers 'on the outskirts of poverty.' At that time, the administration fretted over the tax burden on the working poor, which the White House calculated to include federal income taxes, state taxes and the Social Security tax.  When administration officials pushed the need to create private investment accounts to supplement Social Security, they specifically warned that taxes paid into Social Security would not necessarily be returned unless the system was reformed.  William W. Beach, an economist at the Heritage Foundation think tank, said he was sympathetic to Lindsey's argument that the Social Security tax is not really a tax. But, he said, it was a dangerous argument for a Republican to make.  'Do I allow defense spending to offset my income taxes since I like to be defended? Do I allow road taxes to offset my profits taxes because I use the roads?' he asked. 'If you do start down that road, it's hard to see anything as taxes.'  But for the purposes of a tax reform debate, removing Social Security taxes from consideration could have a sizable impact. The top 5 percent of the nation's taxpayers paid 41 percent of all federal taxes, a hefty share, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. But that same group paid from 56 to 59 percent of all income taxes, an even more impressive burden.  'If we take out Social Security, the poor will look very lightly taxed,' said Robert S. McIntyre, of Citizens for Tax Justice, a tax research group backed by organized labor.  Democrats say the shift could prove ominous for lower-income Americans. And they appear eager for the fight.  'These people are setting the tone in saying the poor really are not being taxed enough and that the burden is too high on the rich,' said New York Rep. Charles B. Rangel, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee. 'We're going back some 70 years.'  Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Calif.), a member of the committee, said: 'I don't think there's any question you have a number of extremists in the Republican ranks that would like to see the wealthy do very well. They're going to try to make the case that the average American is overtaxed and subsidizing the poor.'  But to some conservatives, the shift is long overdue. Rep. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) has argued for two years that the nation is entering a dangerous period in which the burden of financing government is falling on too few people. In such an environment, the masses will always vote for politicians promising ever-more-generous social programs, knowing they will not have to pay for such programs, DeMint warned.  'This issue is coming to a head,' DeMint said earlier this month, just minutes after making his pitch to outgoing Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill. 'You can't maintain a democracy if the people who are voting don't care what their government costs.'  DeMint and his allies have called for a national sales tax to replace the income tax. For those below the federal poverty line, sales taxes paid would be refunded, but under the system, at least they will have seen the cost of government, he said. The working poor would accept a higher tax burden because they would be relieved of the need to file a tax return.  DeMint called his ideas 'the duck's feet under the water,' propelling his proposals forward invisibly. Conservative thinkers at the Heritage Foundation and other think tanks have begun expressing similar opinions. Last month, the Wall Street Journal editorial page made waves with an article titled, 'The Non-Taxpaying Class.'  'Workers who pay little or no taxes can hardly be expected to care about tax relief for everybody else,' the editorial stated. 'They are also that much more detached from recognizing the costs of government.'  But advocates of this new line can expect a furious backlash. Liberal commentators have already reduced the argument to an appeal to tax the poor, and even conservatives worry that the label will stick.  'It's hard to conclude it's anything else,' said the Heritage Foundation's Beach.  Michael J. Graetz, a Yale University law professor and tax reform expert, said he could not figure out where the administration's arguments are supposed to lead.  'I would be very surprised if the agenda is to put more people on the tax rolls,' he said. 'That doesn't seem like a good political agenda.'  But Democrats say that is exactly where the administration is heading. Matsui said he sees the seeds of a disastrous Republican overreach.  'The president is making the case that people who earn between $50 [thousand] and $75,000 a year should be paying a third more taxes,' Matsui said. 'I'd love to debate him on that.'  But McIntyre worried that in the marketplace of ideas, the new argument could carry the day.  'I would hope the public would find it repugnant,' he said, 'but I suppose you never know.'           "

I found him groggy and cute when he's sleepy -- not to mention sore and not a little grouchy. Been in LA for the past 2 weeks, training 600 security screeners. The Admiral who's the Federal Security Director here has gone on record saying he wants a total of 1100 trained by the end of the year, so doing the math, that means that there's another, um, carry the one, er, 500 screeners to cycle through in the next 2 weeks. Wheeeee!  Thought I'd write a bit about my day off for Benji's bene -- I was able to pull off one of my favorite things today: the Movie Theater Hat Trick!! Paid money for 'Drumline,' used my free pass (see details below) to get into 'Die Another Day,' then walked across the hall into 'Nemesis' -- an altogether entertaining way to blow an entire day!! My butt's asleep and my eyes are still adjusting to the light, but it was good to get a movie fix.  So it started at 11:00 this morning with 'Drumline.' The movie was 30 minutes late starting because the moved the theater but forgot to tell the projectionist. Oops. The entire audience was up in arms, to say the least (they didn't even turn off the flood lights in the theater until 10 minutes after the showtime) and the manager avoided a riot only by offering refunds or free passes to the entire crowd. Serendipitously, the 30 minute delay worked perfectly, as the Bond film was starting at 1:30. Once done there, 'Nemesis' was only 10 minutes from kickoff, so it was an easy jaunt across the hall!  Opinions  Drumline:  A marching band geek's wet dream. Nearly half an hour of drumline battles, marching band formations, and get-down moves. It would have been very comical if the Lee-Davis marching Confederates tried to do what these bands were hammering out, but it was fun to fantasize about belonging to a band like that. They nailed the internal band politics, too. Definitely worth matinee price, or video viewing at JS' with his monster sound system. A must see if you salivate at the sound of a drumline cadence.  Die Another Day:  I can't say enough how much I enjoy Pierce B.'s James. He manages to make him human, and gives him an edge that Connery had in the early films but Moore could never find. I truly believe that his JB is a cold-blooded killer. Halle Berry, however, never quite convinced me that she was cut from the same cloth. Not that I'm complaining, but she swishes when she moves and it prevents me from believing that she's a hard-edged operative. And Rosamund Pike makes me feel all funny inside and (heh, heheh) my pants got tight when she was on the screen....  Nemesis:  Solid, but not filling. Action-packed, but not 'Khan.' I think my lack of enthusasim is a result of a good thing -- that is, I've seen all the battle scenes on TV -- they aren't breaking ground in that department. Good, since I can get my ship-to-ship action fix on TV, but bad because it leaves me wishing I would be blown away on the big screen. Great villan for this one, but I HATED the whole Data thing. If the next one is 'Search for Data,' I quit (and you know they set that up, too)! I just can't help but think that Berman has wrung the franchise dry.

"732",732,589736,"Aries","           I would have to vote for something by Blondie, Talking Heads (early), or Elvis Costello (early) -- something from the mid- to late-70s, because from 1980/1-onward New Wave changed into something slightly different.  It would be easier to choose an album, like Blondie's Parallel Lines, maybe.  That sounds more pop than, say, Costello's This Year's Model.  But to be honest, the stuff from that time period is really before my time -- I experienced more through childhood osmosis than conscious choice.  If I had to choose something from my own nascent maturity, it would be something from 79-82, after New Wave changed slightly.  From there, I'd choose Gary Numan's 'Cars' or perhaps Berlin's 'The Metro.'  Both of those lean more towards synth pop than Parallel Lines, but it's when I started to become aware of pop music, so it's a sound that has a stronger emotional appeal.         "
"733",733,589736,"Aries","           That's nothing! You should have heard him at 5:30 in the morning on the radio....  Ask him about backwards masking the Tiffany song!  Mir -- thank you very much for the invite, but I will have to regretfully decline as I will be in Los Angeles.  Now, Mr. Shipley:  1) Mr. McVeigh ensured a seared national psyche by getting caught -- without the pulpit of the witness stand and the magnification of the media feeding frenzy, we (Mr. and Mrs. Joe Sixpack) would never have known that a small fringe group of dissatisfied citizens feels strongly enough about the state of our nation that they would resort to such a horrific statement. Perhaps now, we can identify with the British a little better. It's always a shock to find out that someone is so dissatisfied with the status quo they react with such a base emotion as violence.  2) Christians everywhere should never, ever forget that the Bible was written by the post-Roman Empire equivalent of the white-guy-of-european-descent. If you ever want a fascinating look at politics, read up on the politics behind the formation of the New Testament. What strikes me about the whole 'in his own image' issue is what the 2000 year struggle between the teachings of Christ (love thy neighbor) and the age-old human nature (do unto your neighbor before he can do unto you) says about the image of God....  3) I disagree with you on this point -- from our comfortably 21st Century agnostic-leaning perspective, it's easy to lump everyone who wasn't a native in the Puritan camp. Religion was much stronger back then, and our Founding Fathers found it as difficult to create the institutions of our government without God's influence as we would have today building an empire sans automoblie -- it's just so pervasive that it affects everything at such a level as to be inseperable. 'But what about the separation of church and state,' you ask? The context there is the religious persecutions and bloodshed of the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries brought on by the merging of head of state and head of church (see Henry VIII's creation of the Anglican church for the start of that crap!). The Founders wanted a to ensure (wisely) that religion would not be used as state policy. They could not have envisioned a nation without God. Which is why they are all turning over in their graves at the recent 'Under God' Pledge of Allegiance debacle. 4) Couldn't agree with you more on this one. Preach on, brother! 5) Mmmm-hmmm.  6) Would you consider the citizen of an empire? 7) Seems to me the only sure way to correct the media-induced self conciousness of women is to remake society as a matriarchy. Think that would do it? 8) Uh. Yeah. Words are like cool and stuff. Heh, heheh. 9) Are you offering advice to those designing AI? Seems a basic insight that would make things better for those poor saps. 10) Is that because everything is advertising, or is that because you are a crusty old CYNICAL bastard??? 11) Next to hot fudge sundae, of course.... 12) And I am grateful for your wonderful, meandering, barely relevant insights.   P.S. Need everyone's help: I can't decide between 'What's He Got?' by The Producers and 'Talk To Ya Later' by The Tubes as an example the pinnacle of the New Wave sound. Thoughts?         "

"735",735,589736,"Aries","           - I have decided that the Oklahoma City bombing was worthy of shock; September 11 was not.  The anger within disturbs me far more than the anger without. - I feel that the notion of God making Man in His own image is one of the most egotistical and, ultimately, tragic inventions of our species. - I think we misname our Founding Fathers by not going back far enough.  The Puritans are far more evident in our national psyche than the spirit of '76 ever was. - The only thing that will ever unify the humans species is an overwhelming threat from beyond our planet.  In that sense, space exploration and colonization is the only available evolutionary path.  Everything else will forever be violent variations of existing themes. - Love is not what someone does for you, or what you do for someone; it is persistent and mindful engagement in another's spiritual growth. - I wish to be the citizen of a nation; not the subject of an empire. - Women have a right to be angry at the media's pervasive images, but I don't know what they can do to solve it.  As soon as a coherent and effective plan is formed, I'll back it all the way. - Writing is dreaming in language.  This is why poetry is the highest form of the language arts, because in it words are pre-verbal.  Rhetoric does not occur until the mind moves the language from pre-verbal dream into the public sphere. - We think by pattern matching.  This is why it is not foolish to open the refrigerator when  you need the microwave.  Both have doors and handles; you are acting on the premature matching of an incomplete pattern. - It seems everything I see is an advertisement. - Music is humanity's greatest artistic achievement. - I am grateful for cinnamon toast.

CORRINNE CLEGG HALES Critical Care  She could be a puppet, blue strings trailing from the backs of her hands, her index finger, her nose, her mouth, even her crotch,   but her wrists are strapped to the metal  bed rails, also her ankles, and white tape  covers her mouth like a burglar's gag   keeping the respirator tube in place.  If she could see herself like this, splayed out  under a thin sheet surrounded   by shower curtains and stainless steel  and everything on wheels, she might laugh. But she is thinking now of learning to swim   in a slow, dirty river, remembering  how her brother dared her to dive  between his legs, and when she did,   how he clenched her head with his knees  and held her there thrashing,  hitting at him through the water   until there were knives in her lungs. It's cold here. She can't speak or feel or move a finger.   She can't even open her eyes. A voice  tells her morphine, a voice says curare.  It says don't worry. It will wear off soon.  This is all so normal for them they strap people down and knock people out  and string people up like this     every day. They do it to save them.  The woman waits. She thinks she has forgotten how to breathe. She hears  someone gasping from a bed  behind the curtainloud, clumsy breaths far apart, the strange deep brand of breathing   that the dying doas if to prove  they can still do it, as if the air itself  might shake them back to life.

She has red hair, eyes that go from blue to green to grey, petite and very pale, normally a somber look on her face.  She has three brothers and two sisters:  she is brooding and philosophical like Dream, understands the purpose and beauty of Death, shares the insanity of Delirium, has coldness and indifference like Desire and Destiny, envies Destruction for his ability to walk away.   When you first meet her, you would think she is her own nemesis.  She understands your grief and pain and you feel compelled to share and have her listen.  And she understands and you feel soothed.  Then she gives back your burdens to you but adds some and she grieves for you and all the others that she cannot help, but is immobile by her nature.   I take on the mantle of the last sibling.

"856",856,589736,"Aries","           I have not seen the movie, and really had no intention to, but Julie wants to rent it on DVD, so we will rent it at some point.  My reason for not seeing had nothing to do with marketing or what studio produced it.  Since March of 2000, when my daughter was born, our movie watching has dropped dramatically.  Where we used to go to the movies at least every other week, it is know at most one every other month.  From memory, the movies we saw last year were Castaway, Blackhawk Down, SW:II, MIB:II, and Two Towers.  So far this year, we have seen Chicago.  So, that being said, Greek Wedding did not make it onto my extremely short list.  This is not meant to offend or insult anyone, but I find it funny that a film that was aparently not good enough for any of the major studios and became such a mainstream success as an independent film, is disliked by the people who usually like the independent films.  It kind of reminds me of what happened to U2 when most of us were in high school (and Angie still thought boys were gross).  They were liked by a few people (Ben being the one the comes to my mind), and then they got, gasp, popular, and all the people who liked them first suddenly did not want to listen to them.  Johnathan and I have pretty divergent tastes in movies.  Not necessarily in genres, but in what we find enjoyable.  I go to the movie for a couple of hours of escapism, and will usually only have problems with a film because it drags or has gaping plot holes.  From my perspective, Johnathan goes to the movies to see a well produced movie, with a solid plot.  He does not seem to be impressed with eye candy, but more so with the finer details of the film (what kind of lighting, hard vs. soft focus, camera angles, etc).  I, as a fairly mindless member of the general herd, don't notice those things unless they interfere with my enjoyment of the movie.  My general rule is that if the critics love a movie, I don't want to see it.  I have been burned too many times seeing critically aclaimed movies.  As for Jennifer's question about furniture, I have lived in Richmond for 25 years now, and have never heard of the store in question.  Now, it sounds like they make very nice, and assumed to be expensive, furniture.  I don't want to buy something for my house that I will be afraid to use because it might be damaged, especially now with three munchkins cruising around armed with juice and crayons.  So, I will buy stuff from Haynes (at one of their 'best sales ever') accepting that it is not as nice, and almost certainly will not last as long, but then be able to replace it when it wears out, and probably be able to still spend less than a nicer store.

"858",858,589736,"Aries","           All right now, Keeng, I never said that I hated MBFGW. I sneered at commercials because they make the screenwriting for both look unworthy of full production, and thus, wasteful. What's more insulting to the poorstarvingartist than wastefulness? (Answer: not much.) (And I apologise for not giving it a fair shake, but read on...)   I have to agree with your wry observation about successes making failures of art. I am certainly less inclined to see a movie that's gone mainstream, and yes, it is reverse snobbism. That's one of the unfortunate things that I got with my BFA: the belief that artisanally-produced projects appeal to connoisseurs, not the masses. I admit it's skewed (but tell me: How many pieces of furniture have been purchased in Richmond from Ethan Allen or Haynes or (godforbid) Target rather than at Harrison Higgins, who custom-makes beautiful solid goods right on Broad Street at Lombardy?). It's oversimplified & illogical to infer that I won't like a film because it's popularly acclaimed, yet I do it anyway, because experience has taught me that my taste isn't right in step with that of the general viewing public. Yes, I miss things. Yes, I regret the oversights when I discover & correct them. But I'm a stubborn, reactionary little human, and it's the method, although flawed, that's served me best so far.  I know: Judge not lest ye be judged....         "
"859",859,589736,"Aries","           You're right -- success does affect my opinion.  I mean...there was a time when I thought Titanic was the greatest American film ever made.  Changed my life.  Then it made all that money, and boy did *that* change my tune!  And how about Gladiator?  My god, what a masterpiece!  Then the success, and the awards...I see a clip from it now and I'm filled with unbridled rage.  What a crazy monkey am I!  Of course, I saw both of these, so my point is undermined....but give me some credit -- the success or failure of any work has no effect on my personal taste.  What I am reacting to is marketing -- and I will be the first to admit that my choices are affected by marketing, usually to the negative, since if I see it everywhere, all the time, and I gotta love it love it love it, as has been and continues to be shoved in my face re: Greek Wedding, I'm going to be really turned off, even if it is f*ing Citizen Kane.  That may be irrational, and it may be unfair, but it's my choice, and I'm happy to blame it on the studio, and too bad for the filmmaker who let it happen, because if an artist puts his or her foot down, it doesn't have to be that way.  I don't like being treated like a six-year-old, which is what the studio has done and continues to do, and it's a shame that what may be a fine little movie bears the brunt of my reaction, but sometimes that's just the breaks in this devil's deal we call art and commerce.  Dance too close to media saturation, and you get burned.  A lesson for artists everywhere.         "

Call me close-minded. You're probably right.  But I also never saw half the Corey movies, which were all the rage at the time, and I don't really feel as though I've missed anything. Maybe I'll see it one day, but I doubt it will change my life.  Plus, with my impending nuptuals, I don't want to see a wacky 'everything's going awry' wedding movie.

BTW, my cousin drives one - but she bought it after she'd had not one but TWO cars totalled around her in collisions caused by SUVs, after one of which her car had to be sawed in half so that she could be extracted safely. Isn't something wrong here? Why do we have to fight evil polluters with their own oversized weapons?  And hey, aren't you mystified about MBFGW turning into a series? I mean, it's cool that they're all working, given today's economy, but isn't that stretching the idea a little thinly? The commercials make it look idiotic. It's a sitcom, I guess, but really. --And you know, I didn't see the movie, either. Didn't need to. Saw half a preview. Now I've seen the sitcom promos. I'm all set.

"864",864,589736,"Aries","            urlLink  Report: SUVs pose danger to cars   Congressional hearing focuses on safety   Wednesday, February 26, 2003 Posted: 1:06 PM EST (1806 GMT)    WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Congress takes its closest look at auto safety on Wednesday since the Firestone tire debacle nearly two years ago, probing the safety of sport utility vehicles.   Regulators, auto makers and consumer groups were scheduled to testify at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on rollover risks, seat belt use and other safety concerns associated with one of the most popular vehicles ever.   The spotlight will be on the nation's top auto safety regulator, Jeffrey Runge, who last month stunned the industry by criticizing SUV safety. The administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration called for meaningful and swift changes.    Concerned about deaths   Runge, an emergency room physician who will be the featured witness at the hearing, is most concerned about rollover deaths and injuries in sport utility vehicles, seat belt use, and the threat posed to smaller cars by bigger and stronger SUVs.   'SUVs inflict more harm on occupants than other cars do,' said Brian O'Neill, president of an insurance industry group that will release new statistics on SUV safety at the hearing.   The group's report, an analysis of government safety data, will show that sport utility fatality rates have fallen sharply in recent years and are now almost even with passenger cars.   But O'Neill said the analysis will also show that because of their size and weight, sport utility vehicles can cause considerable damage to smaller passenger cars in side-impact crashes.    Making their case   The auto industry aggressively defended SUV safety at a news conference on Tuesday, and plans to do the same before Senate lawmakers.   'SUVs are very safe vehicles,' said Sue Cischke, vice president of safety at Ford Motor Co. She said sport utility vehicles are under attack for some of their most noteworthy attributes.   'They do well in front crashes, side crashes and rear crashes,' Cischke said. 'Unfortunately, many people who are killed (especially in rollovers) many times are not wearing safety belts.'    Acknowledging concerns    But the industry has recently acknowledged SUV safety concerns that critics have complained about for years, and federal regulators and Congress have sharpened their focus on them.   The industry's chief lobbying group, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, has released data that auto companies agree with government figures showing the fatality rate in rollovers is three times greater for those in SUVs than for those in cars.   Auto makers have also promised to work together to reduce fatalities and injuries resulting from weight and size differences of SUVs and passenger cars. Some longer term improvements could involve design changes in one or both classes of vehicles.   The car companies are trying to head off regulation, which Runge threatened to pursue if the industry did not act voluntarily.   But some critics complain the industry is ceding a little ground now to ease pressure for new regulation and that voluntary design changes could take several years. It can take the government four years or more to approve new regulation.    Some Call For Fast Action   Joan Claybrook, a former director of the federal auto safety agency and now president of consumer group Public Citizen, says Congress should immediately mandate new rules.   'The industry has known for years about these dangers and has bobbed and weaved to avoid regulation,' Claybrook said. 'The government has also dropped the ball.'   Claybrook was also a fierce critic of industry and government action during the Firestone tire saga in which millions of tires were recalled in 2000 and 2001 after tread separations and blowouts were linked to more than 270 deaths. Most of those tires were standard equipment on Ford Explorer SUVs.   Congress passed landmark auto safety legislation after that investigation.            "

Bride To Be  Your fianc wants to have sex in a 'restricted space' with your bodies 'really close.' Where and how were you having sex before his big confession? In the middle of a football field with you in one end zone and him in the other?  The first few times you engaged him in gentle conversation, he stalled and hemmed and hawed, and you dropped the subject. If he didn't have any fantasies, he would have said so.  I'm sorry, BTB, but your fianc is NOT into bunk-bed sex. He's lying to you, dumbass. No one with a fantasy life that dull requires 'several gentle conversations' to draw him out! There's nothing the least bit shameful, gross, freaky, or repulsive about sex in a bed, bunk or otherwise. Therefore, there's only one conclusion we can draw from your boyfriend's big confession: He's hiding something.  The first few times you engaged him in gentle conversation, he stalled and hemmed and hawed, and you dropped the subject. If he didn't have any fantasies, he would have said so, but he didn't say that, did he? So he clearly has some fantasies he was too ashamed to reveal. Then, when it became clear that you wouldn't stop pestering him until he told you something, he made something up. Something safe. Something innocuous. Something that wouldn't scare you off. Something like, oh, 'I wanna have sex in a bunk bed.' Something that, if it were true, he would have told you during that first gentle conversation.  What your fianc really wants, BTB, is to be peed on or suck the snot out of your nose or blacken your eyes or wear diapers. Or all at once. Or worse. But, hey, have sex in a bunk bed if you think he's telling you the truth. You can order a cheap one from Ikea and fuck on it until it falls apartabout three fucks should do it.

"879",879,589736,"Aries","            urlLink BIG BABIES   SUV Killers Beg For Mercy  PITTSBURGH--For more than a decade, citizens who drive normal-size cars have been bullied, poisoned and murdered by drivers of sport utility vehicles. Now they're being asked to like it.  'Did My Car Join Al Qaeda?' asks Woody Hochswender in The New York Times. 'Where I live, about 100 miles north of New York City, at least half of all the vehicles you see on the road are SUVs or other light trucks. They make a great deal of sense. This is not just because we have plenty of long, steep driveways and miles and miles of dirt roads.'  'According to their enemies,' writes Walter Kirn in Time magazine, 'SUV drivers aren't just road hogs; they're also sociopaths who are overcompensating for deep-seated feelings of inferiority. I resent being psychoanalyzed this way. I'm after traction, not dominance, O.K.?'  The road hog set is up in arms over TV ads that call their souped-up steroidwagons anti-Christian, anti-American and pro-terrorist. SUVs have had their windows smashed in Washington, been spray-painted with anti-war slogans in Massachusetts and set ablaze by the lot full in Pennsylvania. Environmental groups sell SUV 'tickets,' and bumper stickers that read 'As a matter of fact, I do own the road,' encouraging activists to stick them on the gas hogs.  Opponents call SUVs wasteful, polluting and dangerous to other drivers. Because these fuel-inefficient leviathans now comprise a quarter of new car sales, and big models like the GMC Yukon and Chevrolet Suburban only get 12 miles per gallon, all of the air-quality improvements made during the `70s and `80s have been erased. 'But a car's miles-per-gallon rating is only one measure of fuel efficiency,' argues Hochswender. 'Miles driven is another. People who drive light trucks quickly learn not to drive around aimlessly.' He's wrong. There's zero evidence that SUV drivers drive fewer miles than other motorists. And even if some have trained themselves to eliminate frivolous miles, then driving a more efficient vehicle those lesser lengths is an opportunity for further improvement. Consider this startling fact: the SUV is the only reason the United States has been unable to comply with the Kyoto Accord on air pollution.  Even more irritating to non-SUV drivers is the sense of being pushed around--and off--the roads by 9,000-pound gorillas. No one needs the results of a formal 'crash compatibility' test to tell them that their Toyota Corolla will fair poorly in a close encounter with a Ford Expedition. The fact is you're more than twice as likely to die in a crash with an SUV than with another sedan. 'Four-wheel-drive vehicles allow workers to get to and from their jobs, and parents to transport their children safely to school, sporting events, ballet classes and the rest,' defends Hochswender. But every SUV added to the traffic on the road decreases the likelihood of someone else's kids arriving alive at school or ballet class. It's basic physics, the law of conservation of momentum to be exact. SUV drivers increase their own security at the expense of other drivers.  Ironically, it's even worse than that. SUVs not only endanger the occupants of smaller cars--they kill their own drivers in roll-overs at triple the rate of other vehicles, according to Jeffrey Runge, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  It's unfortunate if an SUV driver kills himself, but the real issue is what he does to others.  Granted, no consumer is innocent. The Gap T-shirt you buy at the mall is produced by children toiling under exploitative conditions overseas. Microsoft software is packaged by prisoner slave labor. Of course, if you were truly virtuous you'd skip even that sexy hybrid Prius and its holier-than-thou 50 m.p.g. rating and just bike to work. But it's hard to argue with Union of Concerned Scientists director Jason Mark's conclusion that, as socially-responsible purchasing decisions go, SUVs 'represent the worst.'  Short of opening a shooting range next door to a daycare center, buying an SUV is perhaps the single most antisocial act an ordinary American can commit. And as resentment against this egocentrism coalesces into anger, SUV owners are becoming defensive. Kirn again: 'Nothing takes the pleasure out of driving like the suspicion that at every four-way stop, someone in a fuel-efficient compact is sneering at my moral deficiencies. I want to scream, `But I live on a dirt road! I have a farm! See all the mud on my fenders! I need this rig!''  What I would scream back, if I met Kirn, would be this: 'What did you people do 20 years ago?' Back in the days before SUVs, farmers drove pick-ups and the rest of us drove cars. The soccer mom with a gaggle of kids drove a low stationwagon or slow minivan. Nowadays, the overwhelming majority of SUVs are plying our highways and suburban streets. Fewer than one percent will ever be driven off-road.  Why are SUV owners surprised that nobody likes them? Americans have long defined themselves by the cars they drive; is it unreasonable to assume that someone who drives an oversized gas guzzler is a selfish, aggressive lout? People buy SUVs because they're imposing, so they can see over smaller cars. Is it shocking that drivers whose sight lines are blocked by these hulking machines, and who are blinded at night by the headlights of great overbearing tailgaters, are resentful?  More and more SUV drivers are coming out of stores to find their vehicles 'keyed,' stickered or worse, and SUVs are replacing fur coats as the spray paint target of choice. Sure it sucks, but can SUV owners complain? Vandalizing property is a mere misdemeanor next to willfully endangering other people's lives and hastening the demise of the planet.  'What are we supposed to do now, turn our SUVs in?' asks Hochswender. Well, yeah. And quit whining because everybody hates you.   urlLink - Ted Rall           "

"889",889,589736,"Aries","           The only arrogance I personally see in Bush II is his language which places him and America as the representatives of Good, capital G, and our enemies as representatives of Evil, capital E.  This kind of language scares and enrages me, regardless of the speaker.  Any other disagreement I have with Bush II et. al. is a matter of philosophy or economics.  As to acts of will:  I'm not sure that limiting another's options to agreeing or stepping aside is necessarily an accurate definition of non-arrogance.  Consider the State planning a freeway or landfill near one's neighborhood; it tells the residents to agree or step aside, and not to stand in the way -- after all, look at all the State does for its citizens!  Wouldn't the residents percieve such a policy as arrogant?  It seems to me that expecting (or demanding) no one to stand in one's way smacks of a kind of arrogance.  Also, I'm not convinced that acts of goodwill are points to be cashed in later when one wishes to act with abandon.  I may be wrong; perhaps in terms of history and foreign policy, they are.  Did we really defeat the Soviet Union, or did the Soviet Union fall victim to its own geography and internal corruption?  P.S.  Keep Angie in your thoughts -- the recent flareup of her fibromyalgia continues to cause great pain and sadness.  Today's visit to the rheumatologist revealed some new strategies, but no new information.

First, the easy ones  Miriam - rest, drink fluids, and don't read Salon (Oh, sorry, that would make  me  feel better) Chris - Good luck with the interview.  Let us know how it went.  Also, congrats on the birth of your niece.  Ok, here is a very simplistic solution.  Develop real, practical, cheap, alternative energy sources.  Face it, why did we originally get involved in the Middle East?  To protect our oil interests from the Soviets.  Now we are there and can't or won't back out and let the people solve there own problems, in part, because we are dependent on the bubbling crude.  If you develop a hydrogen car (very easy in theory, tough in execution because of no infrastructure to deliver the H2), our oild demands would drop.  I would think that you could also use that technology to heat homes (reducing the need for fuel oil).  It would probably lower our nationwide demand for oil to the point that we could provide our own national requirements, or get it from non-OPEC countries.  Imagine what that would do for air quality.  If that happens, why would we stay in areas that we are not wanted and that don't serve our national interests.  That would allow us to pull out of Saudi Arabia, supposedly making the Islamic extremists happy (I'll believe that when I see it), since we would no longer be on Holy ground.  BTW, the last I knew, Prince Sultan airbase is out in the middle of the desert, not surrounding Mecca or Medina, but hey, what do I know, I'm just a Christian infidel.  Now, to reality.  Johnathan, in this case, I don't think we can negotiate on one side and use military force on the other.  Concerning Israel, we have limited military presence in Israel, probably just in the form of observers and exchange officers.  We (the US) became a target because of our support for Israel.  The option of abandoning Isreal and letting things go as the two sides want, would, to me, give the message that we will let the Arabs finish the job Hitler started.  I know that is not what you are proposing, but that is how *I* see a change in our stance playing out.  As for giving the Palestinians there own country, that sounds good in theory.  But, will Arafat or whoever is the leader use all his resources to prevent Palestine from becoming the launching point and safe haven for organizations like Hamaas and Islamic Jihad in their effort to destroy Israel?  His track record is not great so far, thus Isreal's stance on the issue, and I don't see where we can tell Isreal that they have to give up territory to an enemy that is sworn to destroy them.  Concerning Saudi Arabia, at this point, we don't have any choice but to have troops there.  Prince Sultan is an established base that is currently critical to the implending conflict.  The ironic thing is that the base was closed and our troops were removed after the Gulf War.  Then, circa 1995, the base was reopened.  You know why?  Because Iraq was proving to be less than compliant with UN requirements.  So, if Iraq becomes democratic, or, as tangentially suggested by my esteemed colleague from the great region of NOVA, the 51st state, we won't need to have troops on what is considered by some to be holy ground.  Either because they won't be needed at all or because they will be able to operate from Iraq.  In summary, I don't think we can negotiate and retaliate in this case.  Imperialist America.  I am pretty much a Hawk, but that idea does not sit well with me.  If we ever are going to have a world wide government, it must be done through peaceful means if it is to last.  Military conquest will not work, because enough people will feel oppressed to overthrow the imperialist aggressors.  Lovely Angie, you mean that there is more to America the Mickey D's and Swoosh shoes?  Man, I have been living in cave.  Seriously though, could you or Chris explain the basis of the 'arrogant conservative President' comment.  There are lots of adjectives I would agree with when describing President Bush, but arrogant is not one of them.  He expects our allies to either support us (Britain and many other European countries) or get out of the way (Canada), but definitely not stand in the wat (France-Germany).  Given all that the US has done for the world and Europe specifically in the last century (led the Allies in defeating Hitler, defeated the Soviet Union without firing a shot), I think we are entitled to at least expect the main benefactors of the US to not get in our way.  I don't care if they choose to not get involved for internal political or other reasons.  Just step aside.  I don't see that as arrogant.  Chris, there are many people around the world and quite a few in the US who don't believe that capitalism will help the raise the qulity of life in the world.  Many people still dream of socialist or communist states.  Enough rambling for now.  Lunch was supposed to be over half an hour ago.           "

Kind of ironic, when one considers how much a certain party insists on using language that suggests that they, and the country, are...the servant of God.  I feel both sides, for or against, are presenting only partially convincing arguments.  Both sound good to a point, but then they drop off into the la-la land of kneejerk idealistic political party lockstepping -- I follow along for a while, nodding in agreement, until it suddenly seems to me as if out of nowhere the proponent whips out his or her ideological dick and starts waving it around.  I must say, though, that I'm glad we're sending *billions* to Turkey so they'll let us put a base there.  I'd hate to think we could have wasted some of that money on collapsing school buildings, kids without health insurance, or parents unable to tend to their mentally ill children.

"912",912,589736,"Aries","           Ahem. Sorry I'm late for the discussion, but I had to clean up the small flood in my basement first. It might not surprise any of you that I have some thoughts about the upcoming conflict and the issues surrounding it.  Let me apologize in advance, as this is going to be long as crap, but bear with me (I've been thinking a lot about these issues lately -- time is about the only thing my  unemployed ass can afford these days).  First, though, I have but one word for the way the Bush Administration has handled foreign policy since the collapse of the Taliban in Afghanistan:   Amateurish . If you don't like that one, here're some other choices: sloppy, slapdash, clumsy, crude, slipshod, inept, bungling, or incompetent.  The Model UN Conference that I attended in 1992 at Princeton would have produced more elegant diplomacy than that of the leadership of the current administration. I have been continuously amazed and dismayed at the ineptitude with which this administration has conducted foreign policy. Bush II sold his soul (with the tacit approval of the Republican National Committee) to the conservatives in 2000 in order to win South Carolina and staunch the grassroots support that was propelling John McCain to the Republican nomination. Woe to the future of our country as a result, for the very same conservatives that now have a hotline to the Oval Office (or perhaps more importantly, to Carl Rove's office) and they are giving our reputation as thorough a drubbing as Clinton did back in 92-93. The ham-handed and despicably snotty attitude with which this administration has approached the rest of the world has directly lead to the worst crisis in NATO history and an intransigent and increasingly hostile UN. I was relieved to see that I wasn't the only one of this opinion last Sunday -- read this article:  Forceful Tactics Catch Up With U.S.  Turns out that the US is only reaping what it was sown over the past 2 years, starting with our disgraceful behavior re: the Kyoto Accord and going downhill from there. (Some of you might remember my support for our withdrawal from the ABM Treaty -- mind you, I still think that we did the right thing -- just in a terribly wrong fashion....)  So, registering my strong, nay intense, disapproval for the manner in which Mr. Bush II conducts his foreign policy, let me now tell you why going to war is not only right, but in the best interests of the US in the long-run: lubing the wheels of regime change in Iraq means the difference between John and Johnathan's nightmarish and ultimately impossible proposal of utterly annihilating all extremists in order to live peacefully, and influencing the world in such a positive manner that extremists will be relegated to John's desert, where they can do little harm.   But first we must set aside all of the emotional and bleeding heart baggage in order to discuss  realpolitik  in a form Cardinal Richelieu would immediately recognize and approve. So, let's set aside the fact that war is destructive and killing people is wrong -- that's a given. Set aside the wrong-headed argument that this is about oil -- 1) unless you are living in a cabin in the wilderness without electricity and  any  modern convenience, you  must  accept the fact that oil is the lifeblood of our modern society and therefore securing a stable and cheap source incontrovertibly benefits all of us; and 2) If oil was on Bush II's mind, we would invade Venezuela, whose crisis has posed a more serious oil problem for the United States than Iraq ever could. Set aside the fact that this whole thing with Iraq feels like 'You beat up on my dad by defying him, so I'm gonna beat up on you...' -- since the hawks of Bush II's administration were all veterans of Bush I, we can assume that that  certainly  had a lot to do with choosing Iraq as the next target after the Taliban folded like a cheap card table. Johnathan, the reason you noticed the link between terrorism and Iraq has been downplayed is because  there isn't one.  Regardless of all of these issues, there are compelling reasons for us to go to war in the desert again.  So let's talk geopolitics: On the day the war ends (and I'm not taking a big leap by assuming that we win), then the  entire geopolitics of the region will be redefined . Every country bordering Iraq will find not the weak formations of the Iraqi army along their frontiers, but US and British troops. We will be able to reach into any country in the region with covert forces based in Iraq, and we could threaten overt interventions as well. We will not need permission from regional hosts for the use of facilities, so long as either Turkey or Kuwait will permit transshipment into Iraq. In short, a U.S. victory will change the entire balance of power in the region, from a situation in which the US must negotiate its way to war, to a situation where we are free to act as we will.   If we consider the post-Iraq war world, it is no surprise that the regional response ranges from publicly opposed/privately not displeased to absolute opposition. Certainly, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Iran (and Jordan, to a lesser extent) have nothing to gain from a war that will be shaped entirely by the United States. Kuwait and Turkey are the other countries bordering Iraq, and they are in the US camp already. Syria, Saudi Arabia and Iran have been banking on European resistance to a war to prevent it. It remains to be seen if that can happen -- personally, I think that Bush II will pull the trigger no matter what the UN decides in the end. And the rest of NATO has already come out in support -- magnifying the split within the European Union between the big nations and the small (Germany and France vs. everyone else). And don't even get me started on my opinions about why France is opposing the war.... The European split -- and the real possibility that France and Germany ultimately will endorse war in some way in order to reap the not insubstantial benefits of rebuilding Iraq -- mean that war cannot be prevented. Saddam will not abdicate or be overthrown until the war is well under way. Therefore, it is highly likely that the war will take place, the US will occupy Iraq, and that the map of the Middle East will change profoundly.  The Bush II administration is well-aware that its increased presence in the region will result in greater hostility. However, we should view this rising cost as acceptable so long as Washington is able to redefine the behavior of countries neighboring Iraq. In the long run, though, geopolitical power will improve US security interests in spite of growing threats. To be more precise, Islamic hostility at a certain level as a given, and does not regard an increase in that hostility as materially affecting its interests.  The conquest of Iraq will not be a minor event in history: It will represent the introduction of a new imperial power to the Middle East and a redefinition of regional geopolitics based on that power. The US will move from being an outside power influencing events through coalitions, to a regional power that is able to operate effectively on its own. Most significant, countries like Saudi Arabia and Syria will be living in a new and quite unpleasant world. And, perhaps more importantly, it will offer the opportunity to create a democratic state in the Middle East that actually works. A place where democracy and capitalism are afforded the opportunity to grow and flourish. And this, more than any other reason, is why it's important for us replace Saddam by any means necessary.   Because this gets down to the root of the issue, as JS has urged us to do.  It comes down to this: Where there is globalization and economic opportunity, John and Johnathan's extremists are forced into the proverbial desert. Where there is economic stagnation and political repression, and the extremists not only operate in the open, but they are a powerful force in that society. So, rebuilding Iraq  a la   Germany after WWII is not only good morality, but it is solid strategic vision.  If you have the chance, get your hand on a copy of the 1 March edition of Esquire Magazine. Inside, you will find an article written by Thomas Barnett entitled: 'The Pentagon's New Map. It Explains Why We're Going To War, And Why We'll Keep Going To War.' If you cannot find this article, I have an electronic version I will be glad to email you. It is very important that everyone reads and understands this new paradigm -- remember that the world is an inherently more dangerous place since the end of the Cold War, and this theory goes a long, long way to help us to understand the situation in the world and our place in it. Here are the first couple of paragraphs, which mirror my thoughts exactly:  'Let me tell you why military engagement with Saddam Husseins regime in Baghdad is not only necessary and inevitable, but good.   When the United States finally goes to war again in the Persian Gulf, it will not constitute a settling of old scores, or just an enforced disarmament of illegal weapons, or a distraction in the war on terror. Our next war in the Gulf will mark a historical tipping point the moment when Washington takes real ownership of strategic security in the age of globalization.   That is why the public debate about this war has been so important: It forces Americans to come to terms with I believe is the new security paradigm that shapes this age, namely, Disconnectedness defines danger. Saddam Husseins outlaw regime is dangerously disconnected from the globalizing world, from its rule sets, its norms, and all the ties that bind countries together in mutually assured dependence.   The problem with most discussion of globalization is that too many experts treat it as a binary outcome: Either it is great and sweeping the planet, or it is horrid and failing humanity everywhere. Neither view really works, because globalization as a historical process is simply too big and too complex for such summary judgments. Instead, this  new world must be defined by where globalization has truly taken root and where it has not.    Show me where globalization is thick with network connectivity, financial transactions, liberal media flows, and collective security, and I will show you regions featuring stable governments, rising standards of living, and more deaths by suicide than murder. These parts of the world I call the Functioning Core, or Core. But show me where  globalization is thinning or just plain absent, and I will show you regions plagued by politically repressive regimes, widespread poverty and disease, routine mass murder, and most important the chronic conflicts that incubate the next generation of global terrorists. These parts of the world I call the Non-Integrating Gap, or Gap.'  Let me know if anyone wants to read the rest of this article  its incredibly enlightening.  So  JS and John  it doesnt have to come down to either/or.          "
"913",913,589736,"Aries","           Sadly, I think you are right in the solution of wiping all extremists out, but that will not happen, nor should it.  There must be some way to get throught the hatred that prevents them from accepting anything but their total victory.  If OBL wants to sit in the middle of the desert and preach hatred of the Zionists and their lackeys (USA), I have no problem with that until the hatred crosses the line and becomes violent action.  Then, I see it as a simple matter of survival.         "
"914",914,589736,"Aries","           Clarification:  I do not define appeasement by addressing an attacker's complaints while simultaneously exacting wholesale and decisive retaliation for that individual's attack, which is the argument I am making.  If, however, there is no way at all to address the attacker's concerns, I argue that there is no option but to wipe out the entire ideology.  Because the ideological warrior cannot be deterred, ever, as long as he or she exists.  I hesitate to use the word 'ideology,' because a counter-argument could be made re: Communism, which one could argue was a deterred ideology -- but I feel any attempt to compare radical Muslim fundamentalism to Communism is foolish, so I'll let it stand.  Waiting out a political, economic, and social movement is far different from waiting out an opponent who is following the words of the one and only Creator of all that exists.  It sounds as if those who support reacting to the deed without addressing the reason, do so because there is, in fact, no way to address the reason.  Since I would rather not see a future in which We and They are locked in violent conflict until the end of our species, it seems to me that within these restrictions, we must wipe out all violent Muslims, everywhere, and strike them from the historical record.  Given these restrictions, that seems to be the only remaining option for a lasting peace for this and future generations.  Please, someone convince me that there is hope to be found in reacting to the deed and not the reason.  The argument and consequences as I understand them reveal to my eyes a future of unending violence, bloodshed, and death upon death upon death.         "

"919",919,589736,"Aries","           If I am understanding you correctly, you think the heart of their hatred for the USA is related to our support for Israel and the presence of troops in Saudi Arabia.  That may be, but there are problems with simplisticly removing the sources of their anger.    Keep in mind that Israel was founded by the UN in 1947 or 1948.  Yes, the existing inhabitants (now known as Palestinians, though there was not a Palestine at that time)were forced out of their homes, but you could (and I am very hesitant to do so because of the obvious implications to the US concerning Native American Indians) point out that the Israelis were driven out of that land that had been theirs for 2000 years.  Additionally, the occupied territories were occupied because the Arab countries have attacked Israel 2 or 3 times and lost.  Israel took those lands to offer additional protection from future attack.  I could be wrong, but I think that technically, a state of war still exists between Israel and Syria, meaning that Israel would be idiotic to surrender the Golan Heights (very strategic land) back to Syria.  In the ultimate irony, the radical Palestinians and Arabs want to drive the Israelis into the sea and exterminate them.  Do you recall the fighting in Kosovo a few years ago?  The Serbs (Christians) were trying to wipe out the Kosovars (Muslims).  Kind of ironic that we (USA/NATO) stopped the ethnic cleansing there, yet religiously related people want us to turn a blind eye and let them wipe out Jews.  As for Saudi Arabia, we may be 'spoiling' sacred lands in the eyes of some Muslims, but we are there at the request and with the permission of the Saudi Royal Family (government).  If the extermists want us gone that bad, then they should petition for a change in their governments policy.  We don't generally stay where the government does not want us to be.  Caving in to the actions of terrorists will set a very bad example for future events.  What happens when the hypothetical pure Islamic nation existis, stretching from Tunisia to Pakistan and Turkey to Sudan, and they then decide that their Eurpoean  or Indian neighbors are living the corrupt lives of infidels.  Given the past effectiveness of their terroristic activities, they will try them again, seeing weakness.  As with most things, there are no simple answers, and I have no grandiose ideas.  But, appeasement does not work.  Just ask Neville Chamberlain.         "
"920",920,589736,"Aries","           If we don't have anything the fire ants want, they go away.  Eliminate the reason.  If we want to get our Retaliation Jones on, eliminate the reason while simultaneously taking out a few nests.  But if we don't eliminate the reason, we have to exterminate all fire ants, everywhere, for all time, faster than they can respond.    Another argument that has been added to the original one:  terrorists act out of hatred of liberty.  For crying out loud.  They act out because they want something to change, somewhere.  We may agree or disagree with that thing they want changed, and we can certainly be angry about their method, but don't avoid the issue by saying they're just mean people.  There is such a thing as kleptomania, and I can imagine a thrill in the act, but in general people steal things because they want them.  All the alarms and police in the world won't stop thieves until everyone has what they want.  Of course, meeting everyone's material desires is impossible.  But we can *combine* deterrents (police, locks, alarms) with strategies that target the cause:  we can educate people in how to get jobs, and show them the rewards of individual work -- both in material wealth and individual pride.  Our country does fairly well with this; I feel confident there is less stealing here than in, say, poor South American cities where there is a lot of law enforcement (though corrupt), no path to education and no honor in a hard day's work or in providing for a family.  My point being, arguing that people steal because they want things, can lead to nearly comprehensive solutions.  But arguing that people steal because they're evil -- what could that approach possibly solve?  Terrorists hate America not because they hate liberty -- I'm sure some of the 9/11 hijackers enjoyed a few shopping malls on the sly -- but because of clear (to them) wrongs that have been committed.  Ignore their reasons in the response, and they keep on coming.  Paint over those reasons with a gloss of 'They hate liberty!  They hate freedom!', and Joe Dimwit Public will happily welcome black+white villains he can zap with his ray gun.  See, the argument has kept roaming farther and farther afield of critical thinking.  Instead of smoking out terrorists, sometimes by force, we're told that we're attacking evil people who hate liberty and freedom.  I still feel there's a strong argument to be made for war -- but somewhere it got lost when we all started wrapping ourselves in the flag and the righteous justice of Almighty God.  P.S.

"924",924,589736,"Aries","           To clarify:  I said the Bush administration *had* a strong case, but exchanged it for weaker one.  Based on the original argument, I support a (brief and decisive) war with full and fair closure for Iraq.  The second (and current) argument, which has added that Saddam is evil to his people, that Iraq as a country is a direct threat to us, that we want to rescue the Iraqi people, is nonsense to me; there are many evil leaders, Iraq is an *in*direct threat by way of terrorists (re: original argument), and there are millions of people all over the world who are oppressed whom we don't 'rescue.'  To me, these arguments fail to support war, and adding them to the original argument has clouded the issue and left me unsatisfied.  I am left supporting the war for a compelling reason that has since been buried under what sells on TV.  I feel like I'm at a football game where I'm cheering for my school because I want us in the championships, while everyone around me is cheering for my school because they hate the opposing coach.  I don't care about the other coach.  I can't join in and cheer as loudly under those conditions.  As to the argument that terrorists will keep coming at us until we make it unsafe for them to operate, etc.:  as I stated before, I believe this is only half right.  If fights break out at the roadhouse because everyone's high on drugs, and we respond by arresting everyone and shutting down the roadhouse, sure there will be no more fights.  But the drugs will move to another roadhouse.  And we don't have the resources nor the will to eliminate all roadhouses, then all bars, then all clubs, then, then, then....  If we don't address the reason in some way, the only sure solution is the arresting or killing of all violent Muslims, throughout the world.  Good luck managing that.  This enemy isn't a Nazi government, a country to be contained.  They're individual people, full of anger they feel is justified, who can wander about freely like ants.  It would be mighty (darkly) funny if we elminated all WMD throughout the world, and the day after we declared victory, some random fellow got lucky and piloted a hijacked airliner into the Lake Anna nuclear plant.  For that matter, after WMDs are eliminated, what's next -- fertilizer?  If our only response is to neutralize them, we had better kill them all, every last one, quickly, utterly, completely, and erase them forever from the history books so that all their relatives and descendents will forget they ever existed.  Rage never dies, and it always finds a way.          "
"925",925,589736,"Aries","           I'm sure this will surprise few (if any) of you.  I support the impending conflict.  I have a hard time calling it a war for two reasons.  First, Congress will not declare war.  Second, just as the Tampa Bay Bucaneers playing Lee-Davis High School is not a football game, the US military versus the remnants of the Iraqi military is not a war.  Given the tenacity of the Israelis, I think they could defeat Iraq in a conventional fight.  Those last two words are the key to me.  Both Johnathan and Miriam have said that the Bush administration has not made a strong case for going to war with Iraq.  I have no doubt that Iraq has WMD.  Probably not nuclear, as nuclear material has a habit of leaving a foot print, but biological and chemical are much harder to track.  I have no doubt that our intelligence agencies, embarassed and pissed off about their gaffes pre-September 11, 2001, have sources and proof of these WMD.  For two reasons (alerting Sadaam of what we know and having him move them and protecting our intelligence sources), we have not come out and said 'OK, over here they have 2 tons of Anthrax, and over there they have 500 gallons of VX.  There are weapons that Iraq previously admitted having that are unaccounted for.  That is scary.  It would not take much for Sadaam to give these things to Osama and his buddies, if it meant hurting the US.  Yes, Sadaam is considered an infidel by OBL.  I'm sure Sadaam considers OBL a madman (funny, when you think about Sadaam's mental state).  They don't like each other, true.  But, their hatred of us (and western culture in general) is greater.  The enemy of my enemy is my friend (for now).  Why do you think we supported Iraq in their war against Iran?  Because we thought Sadaam was a righteous dude?  Heck no.  It was because our choices of opposition to Iran (who was holding the hostages) were extremely limited (the Soviet Union, like that would happen, and Afghanistan, who, oh by the way, had been invaded by the Soviet Union.  So, we made a deal with the devil in the name of trying to get our people back.  So, if OBL sent Sadaam a message saying he had a way to get a WMD into NYC, DC, or LA, don't you think he would give OBL whatever was needed to deliver it there?  I agree, peace and diplomacy should always be the first option, but we have had 12 years of defiance of the terms Sadaam agreed to as part of the end of the Gulf War.  That is the difference between 'defying' an optional treaty that you didn't sign (Kyoto and the International War Crimes) versus a treaty that was part of the terms of your surrender.  How much longer are we supposed to give him to comply?  At what point do we say enough is enough?  When a city disappears in a mushroom cloud or a VX bomb goes of in Central Park?  Three thousand people were killed a year and half ago by Islamic extremists.  They will keep coming at us until we make it unsafe for them to operate anywhere in the world and give them no support structure supplying weapons and money.  Now, if it ends up that Iraq does not have WMD, you will see a huge backlash against Bush, and Edwards/Kerrey/Clinton/Gephardt will be the next president.  That, quite frankly, scares the hell out of me.  But, if the peoples trust is broken, Bush will not survive politically.         "
"926",926,589736,"Aries","           Regardless of one's opinion regarding Iraq, it is undeniable that should individuals or groups decide to retaliate, it will be us -- you, me, our families, our friends -- who will be the favored target.

Undersecretary of State Marc Grossman told Congress last week that it might be two years before the Iraqis regained administrative control of their country.

"929",929,589736,"Aries","           op ed from the ny times February 21, 2003 The Martial Plan By PAUL KRUGMAN    he Marshall Plan was America's finest hour. After World War I, the victors did what victors usually do: they demanded reparations from the vanquished. But after World War II America did something unprecedented: it provided huge amounts of aid, helping both its allies and its defeated enemies rebuild.   It wasn't selfless altruism, of course; it was farsighted, enlightened self-interest. America's leaders understood that fostering prosperity, stability and democracy was as important as building military might in the struggle against Communism.   But one suspects that our current leaders would have jeered at this exercise in 'nation-building.' And they are certainly following a very different strategy today.  It's not that the Bush administration is always stingy. In fact, right now it is offering handouts right and left. Most notably, it has offered the Turkish government $26 billion in grants and loans if it ignores popular opposition and supports the war.   Some observers also point out that the administration has turned the regular foreign aid budget into a tool of war diplomacy. Small countries that currently have seats on the U.N. Security Council have suddenly received favorable treatment for aid requests, in an obvious attempt to influence their votes. Cynics say that the 'coalition of the willing' President Bush spoke of turns out to be a 'coalition of the bought off' instead.  But it's clear that the generosity will end as soon as Baghdad falls.  After all, look at our behavior in Afghanistan. In the beginning, money was no object; victory over the Taliban was as much a matter of bribes to warlords as it was of Special Forces and smart bombs. But President Bush promised that our interest wouldn't end once the war was won; this time we wouldn't forget about Afghanistan, we would stay to help rebuild the country and secure the peace. So how much money for Afghan reconstruction did the administration put in its 2004 budget?  None. The Bush team forgot about it. Embarrassed Congressional staff members had to write in $300 million to cover the lapse. You can see why the Turks, in addition to demanding even more money, want guarantees in writing. Administration officials are insulted when the Turks say that a personal assurance from Mr. Bush isn't enough. But the Turks know what happened in Afghanistan, and they also know that fine words about support for New York City, the firefighters and so on didn't translate into actual money once the cameras stopped rolling.   And Iraq will receive the same treatment. On Tuesday Ari Fleischer declared that Iraq could pay for its own reconstruction ?even though experts warn that it may be years before the country's oil fields are producing at potential. Off the record, some officials have even described Iraqi oil as the 'spoils of war.'   So there you have it. This administration does martial plans, not Marshall Plans: billions for offense, not one cent for reconstruction.   Of course, postwar reconstruction in Europe and Japan wasn't just a matter of money; America can also be proud of the way it built democratic institutions. Alas, the Bush administration's postwar political plans are even more alarming than its economic nonchalance.   Turkey has reportedly been offered the right to occupy much of Iraqi Kurdistan. Yes, that's right: as we move to liberate the Iraqis, our first step may be to deliver people who have been effectively independent since 1991 into the hands of a hated foreign overlord. Moral clarity!   Meanwhile, outraged Iraqi exiles report that there won't be any equivalent of postwar de-Nazification, in which accomplices of the defeated regime were purged from public life. Instead the Bush administration intends to preserve most of the current regime: Saddam Hussein and a few top officials will be replaced with Americans, but the rest will stay. You don't have to be an Iraq expert to realize that many very nasty people will therefore remain in power ?more moral clarity! ?and that the U.S. will in effect take responsibility for maintaining the rule of the Sunni minority over the Shiite majority.  If this all sounds incredibly callous and shortsighted, that's because it is. But then what did you expect? This administration doesn't worry about long-term consequences ?just look at its fiscal policy. It wants its war; there's not the slightest indication that it's interested in the boring, expensive task of building a just and lasting peace.

"938",938,589736,"Aries","           hmmm.. why i'm against the war with iraq.  1. there seems to be no defined reason why we are specifically going to war with iraq as opposed to any other nation.  they are other countries which have violated u.n. sanctions and decrees (here in the us we simply don't sign the agreements or ignore them) 2. iraq is not a genuine threat to u.s. interests - which violates the powell doctrine (colin powell) that the u.s. should only enter a war when u.s. interests are clearly at stake - he bases that philosophy on his experiences in vietnam. 3. there is limited public support for this war.  a war without public support is not likely to get the funding it needs to be successful. 4. yes, of course, we could win the war against iraq if all we wanted to do was to bomb it and then leave.however,  bush has said that there will be a regime change.  this will require years of occupation by the u.s. military in order to have a peaceful transition - if one is possible.  after an u.s. invasion - it is likely that muslim fundamentalist will be the most organized and well-funded group in iraq. 5. assuming the u.s. does win this war, the kurds, which at this time mainly occupied the u.n. controlled northern half of iraq, would demand their own country.  this would cause unrest in turkey which has a sizeable kurdish population.  turkey would not want to give up land or anything else to the kurds - the kurds are considered 'terrorists' in turkey. 6. as mr. wigglepants pointed out, this also does not solve any of the problems that exist in the middle east.  the islamic population will still believe that the u.s. is occupying muslim lands and should leave.  the palestinians  will still not have a homeland.  the israelis will still be hated by the rest of the middle eastern community.   7. war is wrong unless it is the absolute last resort - diplomacy is still an option. 8.  what gives the u.s. the right to dispose of a leader?  and why just saddam hussein?  where does it go from here?  9. how does this fight the war on terrorism?  will we be safer after this?

I think that second marketplace that was hit (the one that killed 50+ Iraqi civilians) was planted by Iraqi security forces -- the timing was too convenient, and they didn't do anything to restrict reports from reporting on it -- even better -- they  encouraged  reporters to go there and see for themselves.  We're in for the long-haul, kids. So sit back and stay tuned.

The documentary maker won his first Oscar for Bowling for Columbine, but he brought the other nominees on stage with him in what he called a show of solidarity for nonfiction during these fictitious times.   We live in the time where we have fictitious election results that elect a fictitious president, Moore said. We live in a time where we have a man who's sending us to war for fictitious reasons, whether it's the fiction of duct tape or the fiction of orange alerts.   Applause gave way to some boos, as the orchestra began playing to cue the filmmaker to leave the stage.   We are against this war, Mr. Bush. Shame on you, Mr. Bush. Shame on you, Moore shouted.   Afterward, host Steve Martin tried to restore levity.   It was so sweet backstage, you should have seen it, Martin joked. The Teamsters were helping Michael Moore into the trunk of his limo.   Bowling for Columbine was Moore's exploration of gun violence in America. The title refers to the fact that gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold went bowling before they opened fire at Columbine High School in Colorado, killing 12 students and a teacher before turning the guns on themselves.   Asked backstage why he made the remarks, Moore answered: I'm an American.   Is that all? a reporter asked.   Oh, that's a lot, Moore responded.   He dismissed the jeers he received, telling reporters: Don't report that there was a split decision in the hall because five loud people booed.   The rotund, scruffy-bearded activist from Flint, Mich., also directed the 1989 documentary Roger & Me, in which he pursued former General Motors Corp. boss Roger Smith to confront him about the collapse of the auto industry in Moore's hometown.   He's also the author of the best-selling book Stupid White Men ... And Other Sorry Excuses for the State of the Nation, which criticizes American politicians for favoring corporate wealth over public well-being.   Scattered appeals for peace and grim reports from the U.S.-led war in Iraq added a sober contrast to Hollywood's traditional night of glitzy self-glorification.   In light of all the troubles in this world, I wish us all peace, Chris Cooper said during his acceptance speech for best supporting actor for Adaptation.   Cooper was among several nominees, including Meryl Streep and Martin Scorsese, who wore dove peace pins on their formal wear as a silent statement about the war          "
"1005",1005,589736,"Aries","           Black was probably a respect for the war/soldiers thing, I'm thinking.  Halle Berry's dress was a bit unflattering...and it's hard to NOT flatter that body.  I kind of liked J Lo's sea-foam mumu.  It was very 70's and fun to me.  I liked that Nicole Kidman and Susan Sarandon had dresses with similar necklines...it was so faux pas, and it made me laugh to think that they might have seen each other and said, 'Shit!' when they got there.    Yes, I'm breaking up with Johnathan and moving to wherever it is that Adrian Brody lives, a location unknown to me, as I have never actually met him and I am totally kidding.  That's just sort of the Angie way of saying that I really like him.  Kind of like how Liv Tyler and Angelina Jolie are my girlfriends.    Oh, and by the way, I've decided that I did not like the color that Julia Roberts had dyed her hair.  It didn't do anything for her skin tone.  And Kate Hudson's hair, skin and dress were all the same color...she looked like a walking tan with lips.  It was a little strange.  I thought Diane Lane looked fabulous though.  And I think Catherine Zeta-Jones is just so cute when she's pregnant.  The only acting I've ever seen her do that I really liked was 'Zorro' and 'Traffic,' so I'm not like a huge fan or anything, but she makes a darn tootin' cute lil pregnant lady.

You should know them already.  1)  FALSE.  2) FALSE.  3) FALSE  As for the oil argument, I can think of three much easier targets militarily and one domestically than spending billions of dollars invading a relatively well defended country.  Let's see, there is (in order of hardest to easiest) 3) Venezuela - Right in the middle of extreme labor unrest, very close to the US.  Would not require as much in the way of a logistics train.  (As a side note, Venezuela is the main reason we have had the price spikes in gas.  They are still only operating at 20% of their normal petroleum output).  2)  Saudi Arabia - We already have more troops in Saudi than they do and we have 250,000 in Kuwait.  It would take like 2 days to 'conquer' them.  And the easiest is 1)Kuwait - Our military is already there.  We could just claim victory and take hold of some of the richest oil fileds in the world.  Of course, the domestic option is drilling in ANWAR, but we know that won't happen.         "

I would need more information and expertise to rank them on my own; however, I do doubt the validity of some of the reasons, only because they are not treated equally in all situations.  2. I cannot speak re: time and the recent inspections because they were not executed in a way I felt effective; their flawed methods rendered them inconsequential; thus, time was irrelevant.  3. I believe that in general, lasting self-governance cannot be forced; it can only be chosen.  I say 'in general' because I don't believe in absolutes; there is always the possibility of an exception.

I'm not much into the recent (last 20 years) jazz.  As a whole, American attempts at orchestral music (movie soundtracks not included) have been pathetic.  Bernstein had some attempts at 'good' orchestral music (Candide Overture).  Copland was the best American composer in my opinion.  But, you can't beat 'the continent' for good classical music.  From Bach through Beethoven to Tchaikovsky (yeah, Russian, but close enough), they had some incredible talent.  I guess what it comes down to is I will admit that, as a whole, European culture, which is after all what all the things we are talking about make up, is better than American.  Hell, we can't even make a decent beer.  I still prefer living in the heathen US, wearing my holy blue jeans, ratty old t-shirt, eating my cheeseburger, deep fried potatoe strips, and watching American football on TV, or better yet, laughing at some of the ugly dresses the actresses wear to all the awards shows.

"1039",1039,589736,"Aries","           Oh, I wouldn't consider myself all that high fashion or in-crowd either...I just know names and products, but I can't afford any of it.  Loreal is a makeup company, but it's a parent company to other professional salon hair and make-up products as well...Laurent is a fashion designer, who might specialize in leather goods, and Gotier is actually spelled Gautier or something...he's also a designer.  Does a lot of stuff for Madonna, I think.  Anywho, leather goods, hair & makeup (and fragrance) AND clothes are all parts of 'fashion,' which is why I lumped them all together.  For example, Calvin Klein also has a line of cosmetics and cologne, as well as shoes, underwear, clothing, etc.  Croissants are extremely bad for you.  But they're oh-so tasty.  I hold that the reason why European nations like France and Italy aren't obese despite all of the foods they eat is this:  lifestyle.  They relax.  Work is not what defines them like it is in the U.S.  They take their time in preparing their food, eating their food, living their lives.  They have siesta.  They are not so focused on making money and working hard as they are living and enjoying life and each other.  And I think that lowered stress level really does a lot in terms of how they look.  I think we as Americans are always go go go...eating instant foods, full of preservatives, shoving them in our gullets as quickly as possible so we can go go go some more.  We're all fat because we don't digest.  And we don't sleep and rest as we should, so our bodies don't metabolize the same way.  Our work ethic is very different from theirs.    And this is not to say that one way is better than the other.  We make LOTS more money here because of our Protestant work ethic.  It's part of what makes us a capitalist nation.  But it's also a big part of why we're a fat nation, too...           "

What does that say about us?'  It says we follow through on our word.  President Bush warned the Iraqi soldiers to not attempt to sabotage the oil reserves because it belonged to the Iraqi people not Saddam and his regime.  The revenues the oil can create would be neccessary for the Iraqis to rebuild their country.  This said, there was a plan in place to protect the Oil Ministry and the oil fields for the benefit of the Iraqis.    Alternately, there was not neccessarily a plan to protect other specific places, because who knew where the certain chaos that was to follow would erupt.  What were they supposed to do anyway, shoot the unarmed civilians?  That would have been all they could have done to stop it.  The crowds were enormous that were taking part in the looting.  The Liberals would have been screaming then that the innocent, unarmed looters had been shot!  Unfortunately, the looting happened, but it was bound to happen.  But, I'm sorry, protecting a museum was probably the last thing on the minds of the soldiers as they were watching there backs for remnants of the Republican Guard or the Fedayeen...         "

I'm not convinced this is a good thing -- if iTunes crashes because of Windows issues, then Apple looks bad, not MS -- but it should be interesting to find out if this is the corporate pale shadow phoenix that rises from Napster's ashes.  By the by -- iPods have also been updated, and I think there will be Windows-compatible versions of those, as well.  Re architecture:  There are several websites dedicated to reconfiguring a Mac to run Linux.  Wonder if Linux will always be an underground, back-door movement.  Not sure what the benefit is of running Linux on a Mac vs. a PC -- maybe it's a cool factor, being in a different box.         "

"1081",1081,589736,"Aries","           Perhaps the problem lies in our language.  In general, we have two words to describe a body type:  thin/fat; tall/short/; etc.  We are a culture of extremes and linguistically-enforced simplicity.  Our language is so pitiful that we often resort to numbers to express ourselves ('Are you happier today?' 'In terms of happy I'm about a 6, maybe a 7.')  For all the praise Indo-European languages receive, more often than not our choices are woefully limited.  Unfortunately, being creatures of language, how we speak and communicate greatly shapes our reality.  And so the wars begin -- often because our limited language limits our thinking, and thus our options.  No poetry, no grace -- only simple, concrete linguistic containers into which we attempt to pour the whole of our experience.  I love my car.  I love my wife.  I hate this pizza.  I love my house.  I love this carpet.  I hate that tie.  I hate war.  I hate flying.  I love my parents.  I hate the quiet.  For crying out loud.         "

Second, compared to the other two women in the group, Natalie Maines *is* the fat one.  She is not fat.  But, she is heavier than the other two.  When comparing a group of people, men are generally vague in their descriptions.  For example, if I were trying to describe something about that pipcture to another friend who was familiar with it but not their names, I would use the following descriptions - the brunette, the skinny blonde, and the fat or chubby blonde.  I will agree that she is not fat, but it is a comparitive tool.  I could just as easily use short and tall I suppose, but that is not a sure thing since one appears to be standing and the other is kneeling on an elevated platform (I think).  I could go with a description I heard from my boss today and describe where as one with the Porky Piggish face.  I'll stick with the general fat/skinny adjectives.           "

It was very much a love me, love my cat situation.  Well, it took about half an hour.  Shadow was a very affectionate cat.  She would generally come when called.  She would even deign to play with us from time to time.  When she was about 14, she became listless and uninterested in eating.  I even tried tuna.  Previously, whenever we would even pop open a can of tuna, eShadow came flying in and loudly meowed and rubbed agains you to let you know what she wanted.  She was still uninterested.  She to stopped using the litter box.  We took her to the vet and she was diagnosed with renal failure.  The vet told us that one of her kidneys had atrophied, and the other was giving out.  We left her with him for 2 days to flush out her system with IV fluids.  For about a week after the treatment, she was fine.  We had switched her to a special kidney friendly food.  But, she eventually started sliding again.  I had the difficult task of coming home one afternoon to find her dead.  It was one of the most upsetting things that has happened in my life, even though I knew it was coming.  That one cat has made me open to the possibility of having cats in the future.

"1095",1095,589736,"Aries","           John - does your question about advance notice reference the Buddhist carvings?  If so, yes - there was a long build-up; I remember following it.  What interests me is if (a) the world community is responsible for the protection and preservation of specific nation's antiquities, and if so, then (b) how far does this responsibility go?  To public pronouncements?  To sanctions?  To the nation's border?  To physical intervention?  It seems that if it is true that we should have physically prevented the looting of the museums (which would have required wounding and killing many civilians on the building steps), then we should have sent special forces in to stop the destruction in Afghanistan.  What troubles me in a greater sense is that in all the debate about this situation and its implications, many of us are inspired to draw definite lines of principle without thinking just where those lines stop and start.  For example:  If we invaded Iraq to liberate the oppressed, why aren't we planning for the next operation elsewhere in the world?  There are plenty of targets.  If we should not have invaded Iraq because it was about oil, then would anyone have ever been able to stop daily rape, torture, and terror within its borders?  I hear a lot of absolutes, but not a whole lot of thinking.  We seem to prefer a world in bright, contrasting colors, drawn in broad, clear strokes, rather than the contradictory mess it actually is.  We seem to fight for easy definitions rather than face up to the unruly reality.  I'm beginning to wonder if our world is not in the clutches of conservatives, or liberals, or lobbyists, or lawyers; if it is trapped and pinned not by these, but by something completely different.  I'm beginning to wonder if our world -- if humanity -- has finally been overrun by idealists.         "

You assume that we were in the area of the museum(s) when they were looted.  Keep in mind that we still have not fully secured Baghdad last I knew.  But, assuming that we were standing right in front of the museum as looting was going on, how should we have stopped hundreds of people from looting/stealing/destroying these artifacts?  Shoot them?  Beat them with the butts of rifles?  The US Army and Marines are not into crowd control.  They are not permitted to operate in a police capacity in the US (posse comitatus).  They don't carry a lot of tear gas, especially when in a war zone.  Their primary job is to identify the enemy, not looter, and shoot him.  Johnnathan - No.  And, did we even have advanced notice of the destruction anyway?         "

"1107",1107,589736,"Aries","           I've been thinking about this...how, exactly, is it our fault if Iraqis loot their own historical artifacts?  They're not our children.  It seems to me that if they don't see a difference between stealing a Sony television from a Baath vacation home and stealing jewelery or pottery of their own heritage and history from 4,000 years ago, then that's really their problem, and they should receive the brunt of the outrage.  The fact that looting was possible -- that is our fault, to some degree, for not planning for a more rapid law enforcement plan (assuming one was even possible).  But *what* they loot -- that seems to me to be merely a reflection of either their own wisdom or ignorance.  I share this thought (which may be changed without notice) because the whole affair has sparked in me an interesting question:  Are the historical treasures of a culture the property and responsibility of that culture, or the world at large?  I'm not talking about interest -- of course they're of great *interest* to the world.  But does that interest translate seamlessly into the realm of property and responsbility?  I'm reminded of the Taliban blasting those awesome Buddhist sculptures.  Would there have been justification for external cultures to use force to protect those works on behalf of the world community?  If not, then why all the anger directed at the world community for not stopping Iraqis from looting their own heritage?  Granted, one can argue that the world community created a situation in which looting could flourish -- but does this argument truly address the issue?  At some point, shouldn't a culture or a people show some restraint and control their more childish, primitive passions?  If they are unable to do so -- is that truly our fault?         "

"
"1157",1157,589736,"Aries","           Here is my opinion on what is going on with the Matrix.  In the first one, the machines created a perfect world, but the human mind would not accept it, so it was a 'monumental failure'.  So, they created a second, less than perfect, world.  As the Architect said 99.9% of the people accepted it.  I think that the machines, not being stupid, decided to create another false world outside of the 20th century world.  This is for those 0.1% of minds that could not accept what they saw.  This new world allows them to think that they are fighting for the freedom of mankind and keeps them from noticing the imperfections in the world because Zion is by no means a perfect world.  In the end they are still just coppertops.  I think Neo is the One that can change the laws of both worlds, not just the 20th century one, which we saw at the end with the sentinels.  That is why he is so powerful in the 20th century one, because to him, it is almost like us playing a kids game.  Doing the math, if the 250,000 people in Zion represent the 0.1%, then that means that the population in the matrix is just under 250 million, or just slightly less than the population of the US.  At 12,000 BTU per body, that is 3 billion BTU, which will run a few lightbulbs.  Now, I have several questions remaining  1)  What is Smith up to? 2)  What happened to the Architect? 3)  Is the Oracle working for the System or freelance? 3a)  If the System, why help Neo? 3b)  If freelance, why? 4)  If the people in Zion are plugged into a Matrix, can they wake up?         "

While many of the articles/comics in the links you post piss me off to no end, I accept them as reflective of your views and not you trying to tell me how to act or think.  You don't necessarily share our passion (to strong a word but I can't think of a better one) for Buffy.  That is fine.  I don't get most of the song lyrics that are ocassionally posted here and have actually stopped reading them.  I don't complain about them being here, I just don't participate in the discussion about them.  While this group is small, it is diverse.  We all have things we like and don't like, things we will agree on and things we won't.  I like discussing things with other people, as I assume we all do or we wouldn't be posting here.  Please, let's not place restrictions on what we discuss.    I am not angry with you about your post, but it did pluck something.  I think JLS was correct in that if this discussion had been about B5, you would have been involved, but someone else who did not share your passion for it might not.         "

"1219",1219,589736,"Aries","           The only discrepancy in the whole article that troubled me was Bush's insistence that he initially watched it on television, if the evidence shows he did not.  All politicians create a reality for us -- a necessity for all leaders, the fictionalizing of the public self -- and any thinking person can easily see through the smoke.  However, it disturbs me when the smoke is this obvious -- not because it reflects badly on the politician (who is doing what all leaders must do), but because it reveals an alarming assumption of the simple-mindedness of the public.  If the article is factual on this point, I would have preferred if Bush had said he heard about it through an aide, or that it was confusing and no one clearly knew what was going on, than to create a story about watching it on television.  If true, it is a silly and unnecessary lie.  Beyond that one point, the rest of the article kind of rolled over me as a sea of timestamps and vague outrage.  Conspiracy?  No.  Confused and silly humans?  Sure.  Unnecessary fictionalizing?  You bet.         "

I cannot believe that the author(s) is harping over 'discrepancies' of 2-3 minutes on some of these events.  If you take a room full of 30 people and ask then waht time it is, I can almost guarantee that you will get answers that vary plus or minus five minutes from each other.  As far as the opening statement that he knew we were under attack at 8:48, I strongly disagree.  It is very easy to sit here a year and half removed from the attacks and state what we know to be true now.  At 8:48, all anyone knew is that 1 aircraft had crashed into WTC.  At least 1, possibly 2, other aircraft were out of radio contact and were not transmitting on their transponders.  It could have been coincidence (a terrible accident and electrical failures on the planes).  I would not be surprised if the message, as it was passed up from ATC to other people (SS and NORAD), that they insisted on confirmation before taking any drastic action.  That obviously changed when the second plane hit.  As for why Cheney was immediately scooted out of the White House and Bush was not out of the school, think for a minute.  If you were flying over DC (which was difficult before 9/11 and impossible now), you would very easily be able to locate the White House, Capitol, monuments, and other known land marks.  I bet that if you were flying over Richmond, a city you know well, you would have a hard time locating specific non-descript buildings like a school.  Now think about a terrorist, with only basic flying abilities and limited knowledge of the target area.  They would have an extremely difficult time locating the school.  Bush was as safe as he could be at the school.  No plane was going to crash into the school.  The White House was a very likely target.  Cheney was in more immediate danger than Bush.  As for the differences in the accounts by various people, does that really need explaining?  Different people, different priorities, different personalities, different memories.  I don't know who or what this group is, but they sound almost as bad as the French author that tried to say we attacked the Pentagon with a missile.  There is no conspiracy here.  The CIA did not kill JFK.  FDR did not have advanced notice of Pearl Harbor.  Aliens did not crash in Roswell (ok, I might not believe that one).  Monica Lewinski was not a plant by the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy.  The US Navy did not shoot down TWA 800.  Did I miss any?         "
"1223",1223,589736,"Aries","           Spike is dead and I'm having a shit day. Thanks for playing!         "
"1224",1224,589736,"Aries","           I agree with some of your points, and disagree with others.  Thanks for the dialogue.         "
"1225",1225,589736,"Aries","           as far as all the potential slayers becoming slayers  at the same time, i don't think that was heavy-handed or took away from the message of personal empowerment. one of the purposes for buffy in the first place was to create a powerful female character who was also human and had human foibles and desires.  buffy was not so much someone beyond us as she was someone who despite all of her powers and responsibilites was so much like us. and, i believe, one of the messages of the series was that we (women), in one way or another,  are all potential slayers - we all have untapped powers that we just need to realize and cultivate.  and as faith herself as shown, just because you are female does not mean you will be 'good' if given the power of a slayer.  faith did turn back to the good side but not before a long, difficult struggle.   now it can be argued that there was no real male empowerment going on - i personally think men have more than enough rolemodels for that already.  and the men in buffy were strong - even spike who sacrificed himself for the love of a woman who he knew would never truly love him back.  such an archetypal theme -- the pain that is borne from unrequited love.   and i agree that the angel part was nice but contrived.  however, the line about her 'cookieness' was worth it.            "
"1226",1226,589736,"Aries","           I enjoyed Buffy's solution, and a few of the exchanges.  Beyond that:  One of the ubervamps nearly killed Buffy; now Andrew, Anya, Wood, Giles, and Xander can take out a few.  Angel arrived to deliver an amulet that did...what, exactly?  Talk about easy fixes.  Good thing Angel set up that second line of defense...where, exactly?  If it was daylight, couldn't they have knocked down the walls so the ubervamps couldn't get out of the hole?  Easy fix, part 2: the scythe.  Please.  Never mentioned before, never fully explained, and looked like a prop for some Klingon blood feud.  And let's introduce Buffy's greatest threat towards the end of the season, with no backstory, no explanation -- she just needs something to hit.  And let's invent a Big Bad that can be any dead person, and *not* have it appear as Tara at any time, or, in the last moment, appear as her mother -- wouldn't *that* have been more morale-defeating?  And throughout the enTIRE series it has been proven that crosses repel vampires, yet not *one* person brings a cross into the *Hellmouth*.  As for Kennedy and Willow, the writers assumed I would care, without making any effort to sell it.  And finally, Spike, who the writers have worked *very* hard to sell to me, sacrifices himself not in a personal, character-driven way, but by wearing an unexplained amulet that robs him of choice -- he never knew what it did, or the consequences, until the last moment, so instead of making a journey from A to B, he suddenly finds himself at B, and figures, what the hell, might as well.  That's not sacrifice, that's circumstance.  I *much* preferred Anya's sudden death in battle.  A senseless death should be a senseless death, not a slapped-together oh-lookout-I-guess-I'm-sacrificing-myself-oh-well death.  Either write a character-driven sacrifice based on clear, high-stakes choice, or let the character simply die in battle.  Meanwhile -- I enjoyed the funny moments, I enjoyed Angel's initial appearance (though he disappeared as yet another casualty in the writer-painted-in-a-corner situation), and I *thoroughly* enjoyed Buffy's solution, though I question the wisdom of ending the series with such a world-changing event -- who is going to teach all these girls?  I predict that, being human, the majority will turn out to be chaotic and dangerous.  But of course, we know they won't, because we all know that if women were given such power, surely they wouldn't do the baaaad things men do, because women are inherently *good* creatures!  Take that, evil evil men!  I am sorely disappointed that the story, which was so effective at creating a metaphor and myth for personal empowerment, ended on such a simplistic, heavy-handed note.  The show remains as important to me as Twin Peaks or B5.  I will enjoy it for many years.  But beyond season 5, it was notable only for select episodes or isolated moments.  To its credit, those select episodes and isolated moments were better than most of the television out there at the time, and that's a high compliment indeed.  Sometime, watch the whole arc of season 3 with the mayor, or season 5 with Glory.  Then watch season 7, and note how it skips and sputters to the end.  It could have been, should have been, so much more.         "

"1230",1230,589736,"Aries","           Why is it so hard to create a movie or television episode that gives me more than a few really good moments?  Why are writers so lazy that they expect me to fill in the blanks?  Why do writers receive so much notoriety not for being very careful and attentive to the story, but for succeeding in climbing awkwardly out of the corner into which they have painted themselves?  Always, always, always leave the party when everyone is having a good time.         "

And, yes, I still need VHS, as I have discovered myself to be a rather late-adopter when it comes to home electronics....  Did anyone here ever watch Farscape on SciFi? I noticed that it didn't make John's list - did you just miss it or didn't like it?  BTW, I really like hanging out with you guys as a group, albeit virtually, since this particular collection of minds can easily switch from discussing the inherent unfairness of international power politics vis a vis the individual all the way over to the intricacies of the universe created for 'Buffy: The Vampire Slayer.'

"1240",1240,589736,"Aries","           It's not new.  For example, my Government teacher in high school referred to little-d democrats and big-d democrats, as well as little-r republicans and big-r republicans.  Usually the terms distinguish between the theory and the party.  It has never occurred to me to apply actual rules to their use.  I try to distinguish between upper- and lower-case in both text and conversation when I feel the need.  In general, the common popular usages are almost universally in reference to a party, even when the speaker claims otherwise, so it's not worth inquiring further.  If, in conversation, I claim simply to be a republican, and the listener hears 'party,' that is generally his or her problem, not mine.  One might as well carry around a pre-made disclaimer to be read every time one says 'god.'  More to the point, to most people I have observed, the distinction is insignificant or irrelevant.  I feel most politically-minded people became so because of issues rather than theory.  Theory usually comes later, and is grafted to become inseparable from the issues.  Postscript:  To be fair, the term 'little-d democratic' is far more frequent than 'little-r republican,' because 'democratic' is such a commonly used term to define a method of decision-making.  Because no one thinks much about how this country is arguably a republic, or why it was designed as one, and because of the cultural saturation of our political parties, it's almost pointless to attempt a distinction between republican/Republican in casual company.  Since (R)epublican has such a universally illustrative meaning, why bother with such a minor quibble as capitalization?  And so it goes.         "

"1248",1248,589736,"Aries","           Two cents:  wrong and evil, and for that matter right and good, are not the same thing.  Also:  of the final examples, I feel rape is the stronger of the two.  Murder is a sub-category of ending a life, and requires more clarification to be both relevant and effective.  A minor distinction, but an important one for your larger argument.  As to the issue of suffering needlessly, I am generally curious:  at what point does the suffering become needless?  For that matter, when is suffering needful?  Is suffering validated by the beauty or wisdom that comes from it?  If one person suffers from a disease and draws on that suffering to compose a heartrending symphony and then dies, while another without such talent stares out a dirty window until he or she suffers the same fate, unknown and unheard -- were both experiences equally needless?  What of the many who will be touched by and grow from hearing the symphony?  For that matter, what of the son or daughter of the other individual, who, having watched the loved one die, dedicates him- or herself to raising a stronger and more loved family than might have been possible before?  Does that person's suffering suddenly become needful?  I raise such questions not because I favor generally institutionalized suffering -- surely not -- but I am reluctant to dispense with suffering altogether by labeling it as needless, without understanding where the line is drawn, beyond the usual extreme examples.  I feel that only by defining one's terms can one be assured of success in any discourse.  Once again, my issue is with absolutes.  I am wary of them.  They occur nowhere in the universe except the human imagination, and I have yet personally to see one single absolute that applies in infinite cases at infinite times.         "

"1250",1250,589736,"Aries","           in response: i am aware of the difference between the upper and lower case 'republican' and 'democrat.'  i ignore them merely out of laziness not aesthetics but thanks for the benefit of the doubt - i am in this discourse referring to the concept  of the republican and democratic parties. and i would absolutely agree with harmony's statement that many people are beneficiaries of our lack of social darwinism in this country and are fairly unaware of it.  not many of us would survive in a truly competitive society.  and those who do believe it, in my opinion, are not only insensitive elitists but also sadists.  to ignore one group's suffering or difficulties because they do not match or compliment the most dominant or successful group is disgusting.  we can judge ourselves by how we treat the lowest of our society - i would think a vegan of all people would understand that.   however, when i hear people speak of the ethical dilemna faced by genetic counseling, i do not see the issue.  if someone can be spared the pain of illness or an impariment than let it be.  yes, yes, we get into the whole concept of how a society decides what is aberrant but really, when do we start discussing the realities of people's lives?  in my own case, as many of you know, have suffered from clinical depression for most of my life - i now take medication to control it.  if this could have been prevented before i was born, would i have approved?  you are damn right.  my depression did not build my character - it stripped away years of happiness from me and no one should have that burden placed upon them even if some intellectuals seem to want to make the world suffer in order to satisfy some form of philosophy. and neb, your questions about who runs what are just questions of policy.  what a country would we be living in if only education was taken that seriously! and yes, neb, i know you think life is a cycle but all we can do is try to do what is best - and yes, that is subjective not only to each culture but to each individual but we all have to start realizing some things are wrong.  murder is wrong.  rape is wrong.  letting people suffer needlessly is wrong.

"1251",1251,589736,"Aries","           r/R, d/D:  The subject is a bit cumbersome for blog posting.  But I will try, by presenting a series of possibly unfair oversimplifications.  As a republican, I focus on the realistic application of the political philosophy, while ignoring all specific issues.  (R)epublicans (and (D)emocrats) usually unite political philosophy and social engineering.  As I use the terms, to be (r)epublican or (d)emocrat is to place a template, a patterned design, atop an ever-moving and ever-changing society.  (r)s and (d)s don't particularly mind what that constantly-moving society believes or wants or fears, as long the overlaying template is there to best realize its desires.  The overlaying template or design exists not as a restriction, but as the best possible expediter of the society's desires.  For example, I believe ideas best flow up, from local to national.  To enforce this empowers, challenges, educates, and generally lights a fire in the populace.  I don't particularly care what the ideas are, as long as they push upward from the grass.  This is exciting and involving.  A democrat might believe that ideas best flow down, from national to local.  Such a path has the valid benefit of increased speed and less effort.  But for various reasons, I generally reject it despite its strengths.  In general, I perceive (R)epublicans and (D)emocrats as starting from this point, but then grafting onto this foundation a superfluous catalog of issues, agendas, and ideologies.  Also, (R)s and (D)s usually strike me as absolutist, which is not to my taste.  I am not entirely pleased with the words I've chosen or the presentation of my ideas, but I felt it only fair to respond to your inquiry.  Most of these ideas and opinions are only recently formed, and are not ready for prime time, so to speak.  But here is a flawed attempt at communicating them, just the same.         "
"1252",1252,589736,"Aries","           I have observed that Social Darwinists are often ignorant of the interdependencies that got them where they are.  Self reliance is equal parts reality and illusion.         "
"1253",1253,589736,"Aries","           JLS - i've not heard of the difference between 'upper-' and 'lower-case' democracts and republicans.  enlighten us...         "
"1254",1254,589736,"Aries","           part of the difficulty one faces with bringing such arguments to certain republican mindsets:   *sometimes*, you're dealing with social darwinists, who believe that only the strong will (and should) survive.  as they see it, the species, and society, is only as strong as its weakest link; ergo, if you continue to coddle the poorest and weakest elements of the population, they will only continue to breed more poor and weak persons.  evolution has proven time and again that when a given species fails to act or become as strong or stronger than their competitors, they soon go the route of extinction.  mind you, this is a rather extreme point of view, and i seriously doubt that anyone who subscribed to it would come right out and confirm this (at least, in political circles).  there are plenty of milder versions of this philsophy out there - and more extreme ones.  eugenics was committed to the idea that, ultimately, we should set a standard for the human race in regards to intelligence, strength and attractiveness, and eliminate any member of the population who did not meet the minimum requirements established by this standard - or at least discourage if not prevent those same members from producing offspring.  this sort of thing is done all the time to other species by farmers and their ilk; why not on our own race, some have asked.  involuntary sterilization of institutionalized mentally retarded persons continued in virginia until about the seventies or so, i believe.  it does raise some interesting questions about the short term sacrifice, long term gain strategy that miriam spoke of; if via genetics, we could eliminate all disease, physical and mental disability, etc. from the human race via the systematic use of genetic manipulation prior and during each and every human conception, why shouldn't we, for the betterment of our species?  this assumes that the genetics in question were tried and true, and took into account the need to allow for some diversity in order to prevent the human race from being wiped out in one pass by a new, never before seen disease.  as for education of and for all youth, i'm all for it - but who's in charge of creating the curriculum?  should it be creatively or technically driven?  should it be paid for on a county, state or nationwide basis, or some combination thereof?  should teachers or parents have more control and responsibility for children's behavior?  should we offer the benefits of education only to citizens of our country, or to those of others as well?    as for 'the social contract which dictates that that we provide the best services we can for each member of society because that's just the ethical thing to do', it certainly sounds like a good and benevolent concept; the problem with those social contracts is that nobody has to sign them.    in the end, the policies and procedures of the nation (and the world, to a degree) are decided by rich men in high towers, as it has been for thousands of years.  there is a revolution every now and again, and occasionally the men in question are dragged out and shot; but the towers remain, and eventually, someone takes up residence once again.  without them, there can be no true order; with them, there can be no real freedom.         "
"1255",1255,589736,"Aries","           I was with you until the last sentence.  It seems to me that ethical systems belong in the private sphere, not the public one.  In general, institutions make lousy ethicists.  Further, I feel the weak link of the sentence is the term 'best services.'  It is impossible for more than one human to agree on what that entails in all cases.  Also, the term 'social contract' makes me uncomfortable.  I have signed no such contract.  Finally, for the record, while I appreciate your aesthetic choice to use only lower-case, it can have unfortunate results.  For example, I consider myself a republican -- lower-case -- not a Republican, upper-case.  As with democratic and Democratic, there are subtle, yet important differences between the two.  As for the text preceding that sentence, I hope the tide turns in favor of those with this condition.  If the resources are available, and the public agrees on the necessary trade-offs, perhaps one day it will come to pass.         "
"1256",1256,589736,"Aries","           to bring up a topic that was introduced yesterday during game -  you need to have  good educational system in order to form a peaceful and strong society.  republicans overall don't seem to understand the concept of short term sacrifices for long term goals.  for instance - something close to my own life - autistic children.  there is a program in place which can actually 'cure' up to 60 percent of all children with autism.  the price of this treatment ranges from free in some states (california) to 55,000 dollars per student in others (virginia)  the conservatives in this state go no we can't put more money into special education!  we don't have the budget!  but what they don't realize or seem to realize is that if they invest the money now they can save money on special education for the rest of the students' lives (the treatment generally takes 2-3 years), not have to pay for special services as they get older - this will actually save money in the long run!!!  and also, don't we have a social contract which dictates that we provide the best services we can for each member of society because that's just the ethical thing to do?

"1271",1271,589736,"Aries","           Justice Scalia's (who may be chief justice soon) opinion on the same case: June 27, 2003  |  Today's opinion is the product of a Court, which is the product of a law-profession culture, that has largely signed on to the so-called homosexual agenda, by which I mean the agenda promoted by some homosexual activists directed at eliminating the moral opprobrium that has traditionally attached to homosexual conduct. I noted in an earlier opinion the fact that the American Association of Law Schools (to which any reputable law school must seek to belong) excludes from membership any school that refuses to ban from its job-interview facilities a law firm (no matter how small) that does not wish to hire as a prospective partner a person who openly engages in homosexual conduct.   One of the most revealing statements in today's opinion is the Court's grim warning that the criminalization of homosexual conduct is 'an invitation to subject homosexual persons to discrimination both in the public and in the private spheres.' It is clear from this that the Court has taken sides in the culture war, departing from its role of assuring, as neutral observer, that the democratic rules of engagement are observed. Many Americans do not want persons who openly engage in homosexual conduct as partners in their business, as scoutmasters for their children, as teachers in their children's schools, or as boarders in their home. They view this as protecting themselves and their families from a lifestyle that they believe to be immoral and destructive. The Court views it as 'discrimination' which it is the function of our judgments to deter. So imbued is the Court with the law profession's anti-anti-homosexual culture, that it is seemingly unaware that the attitudes of that culture are not obviously 'mainstream'; that in most States what the Court calls 'discrimination' against those who engage in homosexual acts is perfectly legal; that proposals to ban such 'discrimination' under Title VII have repeatedly been rejected by Congress; that in some cases such 'discrimination' is mandated by federal statute (see 10 U.S.C. 654(b)(1) mandating discharge from the armed forces of any service member who engages in or intends to engage in homosexual acts); and that in some cases such 'discrimination' is a constitutional right.      Let me be clear that I have nothing against homosexuals, or any other group, promoting their agenda through normal democratic means. Social perceptions of sexual and other morality change over time, and every group has the right to persuade its fellow citizens that its view of such matters is the best. That homosexuals have achieved some success in that enterprise is attested to by the fact that Texas is one of the few remaining States that criminalize private, consensual homosexual acts. But persuading one's fellow citizens is one thing, and imposing one's views in absence of democratic majority will is something else. I would no more require a State to criminalize homosexual acts -- or, for that matter, display any moral disapprobation of them -- than I would forbid it to do so. What Texas has chosen to do is well within the range of traditional democratic action, and its hand should not be stayed through the invention of a brand-new 'constitutional right' by a Court that is impatient of democratic change. It is indeed true that 'later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress'; and when that happens, later generations can repeal those laws. But it is the premise of our system that those judgments are to be made by the people, and not imposed by a governing caste that knows best.   One of the benefits of leaving regulation of this matter to the people rather than to the courts is that the people, unlike judges, need not carry things to their logical conclusion. The people may feel that their disapprobation of homosexual conduct is strong enough to disallow homosexual marriage, but not strong enough to criminalize private homosexual acts -- and may legislate accordingly. The Court today pretends that it possesses a similar freedom of action, so that we need not fear judicial imposition of homosexual marriage, as has recently occurred in Canada (in a decision that the Canadian Government has chosen not to appeal). At the end of its opinion -- after having laid waste the foundations of our rational-basis jurisprudence -- the Court says that the present case 'does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter.' Do not believe it. More illuminating than this bald, unreasoned disclaimer is the progression of thought displayed by an earlier passage in the Court's opinion, which notes the constitutional protections afforded to 'personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education,' and then declares that '[p]ersons in a homosexual relationship may seek autonomy for these purposes, just as heterosexual persons do.' (emphasis added). Today's opinion dismantles the structure of constitutional law that has permitted a distinction to be made between heterosexual and homosexual unions, insofar as formal recognition in marriage is concerned. If moral disapprobation of homosexual conduct is 'no legitimate state interest' for purposes of proscribing that conduct; and if, as the Court coos (casting aside all pretense of neutrality), '[w]hen sexuality finds overt expression in intimate conduct with another person, the conduct can be but one element in a personal bond that is more enduring'; what justification could there possibly be for denying the benefits of marriage to homosexual couples exercising '[t]he liberty protected by the Constitution?' Surely not the encouragement of procreation, since the sterile and the elderly are allowed to marry. This case 'does not involve' the issue of homosexual marriage only if one entertains the belief that principle and logic have nothing to do with the decisions of this Court. Many will hope that, as the Court comfortingly assures us, this is so.   The matters appropriate for this Court's resolution are only three: Texas's prohibition of sodomy neither infringes a 'fundamental right' (which the Court does not dispute), nor is unsupported by a rational relation to what the Constitution considers a legitimate state interest, nor denies the equal protection of the laws. I dissent.               "

"1275",1275,589736,"Aries","           Following are excerpts from Justice Kennedy's majority opinion in Lawrence vs. Texas, handed down June 26.  Liberty protects the person from unwarranted government intrusions into a dwelling or other private places. In our tradition the State is not omnipresent in the home. And there are other spheres of our lives and existence, outside the home, where the State should not be a dominant presence. Freedom extends beyond spatial bounds. Liberty presumes an autonomy of self that includes freedom of thought, belief, expression, and certain intimate conduct. The instant case involves liberty of the person both in its spatial and more transcendent dimensions ...  It must be acknowledged, of course, that the Court in Bowers was making the broader point that for centuries there have been powerful voices to condemn homosexual conduct as immoral. The condemnation has been shaped by religious beliefs, conceptions of right and acceptable behavior, and respect for the traditional family. For many persons these are not trivial concerns but profound and deep convictions accepted as ethical and moral principles to which they aspire and which thus determine the course of their lives. These considerations do not answer the question before us, however. The issue is whether the majority may use the power of the State to enforce these views on the whole society through operation of the criminal law. 'Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code.' [Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, (1992)] ...  The present case does not involve minors. It does not involve persons who might be injured or coerced or who are situated in relationships where consent might not easily be refused. It does not involve public conduct or prostitution. It does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter. The case does involve two adults who, with full and mutual consent from each other, engaged in sexual practices common to a homosexual lifestyle. The petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives. The State cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime. Their right to liberty under the Due Process Clause gives them the full right to engage in their conduct without intervention of the government. The Texas statute furthers no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual. Had those who drew and ratified the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment known the components of liberty in its manifold possibilities, they might have been more specific. They did not presume to have this insight. They knew times can blind us to certain truths and later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress. As the Constitution endures, persons in every generation can invoke its principles in their own search for greater freedom.   The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Texas Fourteenth District is reversed.           "
"1276",1276,589736,"Aries","            from  urlLink Penny Arcade :   I decided right away that I wanted to be a bounty hunter, and so with blaster in hand I began working my way up that particular skill tree. This involved a lot of shooting of rats, bugs and crabs.   At one point on Tatooine, I was standing next to a mission terminal waiting for my turn to use it when I saw a large wookie run past me, firing wildly over his shoulder as a tiny crab no bigger than a dinner plate chased him through town. How sad, I thought to myself. I spent countless hours wandering the hillsides in search of new rats and crabs to shoot. Sometimes I would inadvertently stumble upon too large a rat and be forced to high tail it back to town. I placed my character in 'auto run' and pointed him at the nearest town.   As I sat there staring at my Trandoshan bounding across the uneven Tatooine landscape with some kind of super rat closing in on him, I thought to myself, This is not how I want to play in the Star Wars Universe.

What I want to know is, if the WMD thing craps out, but it's ultimately ok because he was a cruel man and now the terrorists have one less country from which to operate, can we move on and invade and occupy other countries with cruel leaders and ample land for terrorist hideaways?  Or is oil the only remaining prerequisite for us to provide this service?  Wouldn't it be funny if, upon invading Iraq, we had found no WMD, *and* the country had now run out of oil.  If the *only* reason left was the liberation(?) of the Iraqi people.  I wonder what the pro-war side would say then.  If they would gladly invade other countries, to gain *only* the liberation(?) of the populace.  Personally, I certainly hope WMD are found.  I'm ashamed enough of this administration's arrogant, bullying, cowboy, cartoon behavior -- what a fiasco if it wasn't even warranted.

"1417",1417,589736,"Aries","           That's oen of the reasons why I believe in God...'cause I feel like too much happens that seems to be meant for the enlightenment of myself and others.  I know there are many people close to me who, like me, would not be the unique and thoughtful individuals they are today if not for some of the trials they endured and subsequently learned from.    Personally, I have worked toward getting my intellect and emotion on par through lots and lots of therapy.  Therapy really helps me to make the connection between those two facets of myself, and helps me to see the enlightenment I can obtain through my painful experiences, instead of just wallowing in the so-called cosmic injustice.  I could say that all the emotional battery I endured from my peers growing up was unfair, unjust, wrong, and nothing but bruises and scars on my psyche.  But somehow my downward spiral to the bottom of my emotional barrel showed me that I can go up, that if I want to keep living, I have no CHOICE but to go up.  And my intellectual side has made that upward journey a lot easier.  It's wonderful when you start to transform your pain and anger into joy.  It's not always easy, but damn it feels good when you get there.  I may not be able to do it every day, but I'm getting better and better the more I practice.  And it makes appreciating the simple yet immense joys of life and love so much easier and necessary.  I spend a good portion of my day in a state of humility and gratitude for my past pains, becaue I honestly believe that I would not know the joy I know today without them.    And having been to the bottom and back, when you come out on the other side, suddenly your priorities are so much more clear.  Losing everything emotionally helps you so much to realize what's truly important to you, if you allow yourself to reflect on the loss with more of a sense of evaluation and new perspective than in anger and resentment for having had to lose everything in the first place.  I slip sometimes, especially when I'm hormonal, so that's why I continue to go to therapy...because it keeps me in check about what's really important, especially when I start to fret about silly incidental things like my weight and my daily stress at work, things that at first seem overwhelming, but, in the big picture, are nearly meaningless.  The truly important things in my life seem to have a way of working themselves out.    I don't know if I came even remotely close to answering your question, but these are the thoughts that came out of my head when I read your post, so I hope you enjoy them. :)         "

Now the evidence that backed that assertion is falling apart. Richard Butler, the chief U.N. weapons inspector in Iraq in the 1990s and a supporter of the war, recently wrote, 'Clearly a decision had been taken to pump up the case against Iraq.'  If the Bush administration distorted intelligence or knowingly used false data to support the call to war, it would be an unprecedented deception. With a crisis of credibility brewing abroad and the integrity of our President and our foreign policy on the line, we need answers now.  Please ask Congress to establish an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate the distortion of evidence right now.

Richard Butler, the chief U.N. weapons inspector in Iraq in the 1990s and a supporter of the war, recently wrote, 'Clearly a decision had been taken to pump up the case against Iraq.'  If the Bush administration distorted intelligence or knowingly used false data to support the call to war, it would be an unprecedented deception. With a crisis of credibility brewing abroad and the integrity of our President and our foreign policy on the line, we need answers now.  Please ask Congress to establish an independent, bipartisan urlLink  commission  to investigate the distortion of evidence right now. If Bush and his officials deceived the American public to create support for the Iraq war, they need to be held accountable.      http://www.moveon.org/wmdpledge/  www.moveon.org          "

"1453",1453,589736,"Aries","           Q. In a recent Answer Man, you stated Johnny Depp based his character in 'Pirates of the Caribbean' on Keith Richards. While this is true, he also based his character on one more influence: Pepe Le Pew, the skunk from Looney Tunes. Depp says...   'Yeah, I kind of incorporated the idea of Keith. Not like an imitation of Keith or anything but just that wisdom that he carries, that sort of confidence that he has, that attack that he has. So I got that on one side and on the other side I took a little bit of this cartoon character that I've always loved when I was a kid, his name was Pepe Le Pew. Yeah, the skunk. He smelled horrible, but was absolutely convinced that he was the ultimate ladies' man. You know the guy, he'd fall in love with this cat and the cat quite clearly despised him but Pepe Le Pew sort of read it as, 'Oh, she's just playing hard to get. Oh, she's just shy.' '  Sean Leslie,  Salt Lake City, Utah   A. Now that it's been pointed out, I can see the resemblance. And to think I said he was merely channeling a drunken drag queen.

"1454",1454,589736,"Aries","           Q:  I've noticed an interesting trend over the last few years: You can sometimes tell who the 'bad guys' are in a movie or TV show by what computer they use. For instance, on '24,' all the bad guys used PCs while the good guys all used Macs. The same holds true for 'Austin Powers,' 'Legally Blonde,' etc. Why do you think Apple always gets the plumb roles? I'm of the opinion that Hollywood loves the underdog and has a close relationship with Apple computer, whereas PCs seem controlled by a megalomaniac in Seattle. Are there a lot more Mac zealots like me in Hollywood? Does Apple pour sponsorship money in big-budget studio movies?  Justin Toomey, Athens, Ohio  Ebert:  Since many Windows machines look alike, Apple is one of the few manufacturers that can gain by product placement, which accounts for some of the Macs. It's true that the movie industry and creative types in general prefer the Mac. The novelist Tom Clancy sends e-mails with this signature line: 'Never ask a man what computer he uses. If it's a Mac, he'll tell you. If it's not, why embarrass him?'          "

I saw adds for a couple of shows, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy and Boy Meets Boy, or something like that.  It just seemed odd to have two shows like that on one channel if they weren't trying to be known for it.  2)  What happened to Christine Todd Whitman?  I heard something about the Senate confirming a new head of the EPA last week.  Of course, Bush, in his infinite wisdom, pulled yet another Republican governor to fill the slot.  So much for the majority of the states being governed by Republicans.  I think half of them are now, or have been, on Bush's cabinet.         "

Okay, so now *another* book is canon?  What the hell?  Is this a movie or not?  Is it a movie about people whose further adventures are recorded by unnamed historians, or novels about people who occasionally get filmed by some omniscient documentarian?  If both the movie and the book are essentially the same thing, is the movie a better story because it was the one that got filmed, or rather does the book supply backstory that the movie couldn't manage, and if so, why not?  I understand this is just a marketing ploy, but it raises profound questions about the nature of narrative.

"1572",1572,589736,"Aries","           A Citizen's Appeal to a General in a Time of War (at Home)   September 12, 2003      Dear General Wesley Clark,   I've been meaning to write to you for some time. Two days after the Oscars, when I felt very alone and somewhat frightened by the level of hatred toward me for daring to suggest that we were being led into war for 'fictitious reasons,' one person stuck his neck out and came to my defense on national television.    And that person was you.   Aaron Brown had just finished interviewing me by satellite on CNN, and I had made a crack about me being 'the only non-general allowed on CNN all week.' He ended the interview and then turned to you, as you were sitting at the desk with him. He asked you what you thought of this crazy guy, Michael Moore. And, although we were still in Week 1 of the war, you boldly said that my dissent was necessary and welcome, and you pointed out that I was against Bush and his 'policies,' not the kids in the service. I sat in Flint, Mich., with the earpiece still in my ear and I was floored -- a GENERAL standing up for me and, in effect, for all the millions who were opposed to the war but had been bullied into silence.   Since that night, I have spent a lot of time checking you out. And what I've learned about you corresponds to my experience with you back in March. You seem to be a man of integrity. You seem not afraid to speak the truth. I liked your answer when you were asked your position on gun control: 'If you are the type of person who likes assault weapons, there is a place for you -- the United States Army. We have them.'   In addition to being first in your class at West Point, a four-star general from Arkansas, and the former supreme commander of NATO -- enough right there that should give pause to any peace-loving person -- I have discovered that ...   1. You oppose the PATRIOT Act and would fight the expansion of its powers.   2. You are firmly pro-choice.   3. You filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court in support of the University of Michigan's affirmative action case.   4. You would get rid of the Bush tax 'cut' and make the rich pay their fair share.   5. You respect the views of our allies and want to work with them and with the rest of the international community.   6. And you oppose war. You have said that war should always be the 'last resort' and that it is military men such as yourself who are the most for peace because it is YOU and your soldiers who have to do the dying. You find something unsettling about a commander in chief who dons a flight suit and pretends to be Top Gun, a stunt that dishonored those who have died in that flight suit in the service of their country.   General Clark, last night I finally got to meet you in person. I would like to share with others what I said to you privately: You may be the person who can defeat George W. Bush in next year's election.   This is not an endorsement. For me, it's too early for that. I have liked Howard Dean (in spite of his flawed positions in support of some capital punishment, his grade 'A' rating from the NRA, and his opposition to cutting the Pentagon budget). And Dennis Kucinich is so committed to all the right stuff. We need candidates in this race who will say the things that need to be said, to push the pathetically lame Democratic Party into having a backbone -- or get out of the way and let us have a REAL second party on the ballot.   But right now, for the sake and survival of our very country, we need someone who is going to get the job done, period. And that job, no matter whom I speak to across America -- be they leftie Green or conservative Democrat, and even many disgusted Republicans -- EVERYONE is of one mind as to what that job is:   Bush must go.   This is war, General, and it's Bush & Co.'s war on us. It's their war on the middle class, the poor, the environment, their war on women and their war against anyone around the world who doesn't accept total American domination. Yes, it's a war -- and we, the people, need a general to beat back those who have abused our Constitution and our basic sense of decency.   The General vs. the Texas Air National Guard deserter! I want to see that debate, and I know who the winner is going to be.   The other night, when you were on Bill Maher's show, he began by reading to you a quote from Howard Dean where he (Dean) tried to run away from the word 'liberal.' Maher said to you, so, General, do you want to run away from that word? Without missing a beat, you said 'No!' and you reminded everyone that America was founded as a 'liberal democracy.' The audience went wild with applause.   That is what we have needed for a long time on our side -- guts. I am sure there are things you and I don't see eye to eye on, but now is the time for all good people from the far left to the middle of the road to bury the damn hatchet and get together behind someone who is not only good on the issues but can beat George W. Bush. And where I come from in the Midwest, General, I know you are the kind of candidate that the average American will vote for.   Michael Moore likes a general? I never thought I'd write these words. But desperate times call for desperate measures. I want to know more about you. I want your voice heard. I would like to see you in these debates. Then let the chips fall where they may -- and we'll all have a better idea of what to do. If you sit it out, then I think we all know what we are left with.   I am asking everyone I know to send an e-mail to you now to encourage you to run, even if they aren't sure they would vote for you. (Wesley Clark's e-mail address is: info@leadershipforamerica.org.) None of us truly know how we will vote five months from now or a year from now. But we do know that this race needs a jolt -- and Bush needs to know that there is one person he won't be able to Dukakisize.   Take the plunge, General Clark. At the very least, the nation needs to hear what you know about what was really behind this invasion of Iraq and your fresh ideas of how we can live in a more peaceful world. Yes, your country needs you to perform one more act of brave service -- to help defeat an enemy from within, at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, an address that used to belong to 'we, the people.'

The second one, naturally, became known as  the lesser of two weevils.   A three-legged dog walks into a saloon in the Old  West. He sidles up to the bar and announces: 'I'm  looking for the man who shot my paw.'   This guy goes into a restaurant for a Christmas  breakfast while in his home town for the holidays.  After looking over the menu he says, 'I'll just have  the eggs Benedict.' His order comes a while later and  it's served on a big, shiny hubcap. He asks the  waiter, 'What's with the hubcap?' The waiter sings,  'O, there's no plate like chrome for the hollandaise!'    When she told me I was average, she was just being  mean.

Even the king of the jungle knows that readers digest  and writers cramp.   There was a man who entered a local paper's pun  contest.

It is insufferable to claim you 'never' see horror movies (or Westerns, musicals, war movies, teenage romances or slasher pictures). You're presenting ignorance as taste.  The trick is to find the good ones. The French auteur critics did a lot of helpful spadework, resurrecting genres and rehabilitating reputations, but they were not always right -- and besides, you have to feel it for yourself. If a film holds my attention, it is in one way or another a good one. If it moves or delights me, it may be great. If I am distracted by its conventions, obligatory scenes and carelessness or lack of ambition, it deserves to be tossed back into the genre.'          "

It seems that when Thulos took Terranel, the 'local group' of the multiverse was torn away with it, and all exist as a miniature multiverse in the in-between-place.  A side result of this occurence is that, according to Castillion, the dead have nowhere to go, and have been gathering at an unknown city for millenia.  Castillion is now dedicated to renewing contact with the gods, if possible.  He has recommened that the party join forces with the Harpers, a secret society formed by the last Elven bard at the very end of the Great Retreat.  Upon seeing Calleum and the banner of Heironeous in a magical viewing painting/frame on Din Dal Kut's office wall, Burne leapt to join his mentor, and was last seen in a battle in Rashemen, one of the lands that borders the Far East.  The act broke the portal, and the party was unable to follow.  Also, Castillon is Ian's father.  Having reached the end of the original journey, Ian and Gregory are beginning to question if they should continue, or return to Tilverton to tell of Castillion's demise -- which was Castillion's request, as the truth would be too difficult to understand.  Players have the option of sending their character off to do something long-term, and create and play a new character.  The world stage has expanded wide enough to accomodate such.  Once the false murder rap is resolved, the party may see the Breaking of the original Fellowship -- but the beginning of a much larger, world-spanning epic.         "

"1703",1703,589736,"Aries","           Hey John!  It's weird to hear that you didn't think that people in the UK care about US politics.  The article that Ben put up was from the  Independent  and it is one of the most reputable and widespread newpapers here.  That story was on the front page.  People in Europe generally know more about US politics than Americans do, since our decisions seem to greatly affect them.  People here are terrified that George Bush is going to get elected again and when they hear things like that story, they get even more nervous.  They blame Bush for dragging them into a war that they don't want to be in.  The protest against the invasion of Iraq in London last February was the largest public demonstration that has ever occured in England.  Tony Blair completely ignored the consensus of the people, which led to his lovely nickname, 'Bush's Bitch'.  Due to Blair's alliance with the US concerning the occupation of Iraq, the Labour party might lose its power in the up-coming elections.  The Liberal Democrats have already gained alot of seats in Parliment and polls show that they will most likely gain many more.  America is a super power and right now Bush's shitty foreign diplomacy skills have angered people all over the world and caused them to rally against us.  Now the papers are saying that the US is giving Iran a deadline to prove that it doesn't have nuclear weapons.  Sound familiar?  That worked so well last time.  How that hell can you prove that you don't have something?  Any way, the majority of people here are intensely hoping that Bush will get voted out soon.  English media is typically very well researched.  The newspapers here were the first to release reports on the how Bush stole the Florida election.  Okay...just realized that I'm rambling, so I'm going to stop myself there.    On to fun things.  Nick, my boy here, is coming to the US for Christmas!  Yay.  Isn't that exciting?  He might be performing at that new comedy club in Richmond, but his agent is still working that out.  Miriam, hope you realize that you're hanging out with me when I get home, cause you have to meet him.  Okay.  That's all.         "

The thermal imaging thing is basically a double check to make sure that there are not more votes recorded on the computer's memory card than were actually cast.  It does it by having heat sensors that detect the heat from your fingers as you touch the screen.  The problem that I don't understand is how do you keep that number from being messed with?  Then again, I am not a computer software exper.  As for Franken, I ignore him just as I do Bill O'Reilly.  Thinking about, the reason they hate each other so much is that they are just alike except for the extreme opposition of their political views.  As for Rush, I am currently in a phase of not listening to him, but it will be interesting to see what happens when he comes back from rehab.

"
"1709",1709,589736,"Aries","           Ben - Honestly I did not read the entire article.  When I started seeing where it was going with the tone of it being a Republican/republican conspiracy AND saw that I was maybe a third of the way through, I did stop reading.  I tried to be clear that I was not attcking Ben Haley directly with my thoughts on the response to the 2000 elections by saying the collective you.  I used your name just to make sure you saw it, since you posted the original article.  I apolgize for the force of my reposne, but it set me off yesterday.  I get a little tired of the 'corporations are evil' and 'corporations have the Republicans in their pockets' attitudes.  Assuming for a moment that the second is true (which I do not agree with since most corporations grease the palms of just about any politician, regardless of party affiliation, to make sure they have access to power brokers),  a corporation is going to do what it can to make sure it stays profitable.  To assist with that, they need to be able to influence politicians.  It is generally easier to influence someone to you point of view if they are already close to it to begin with.  Conservitives tend to favor less taxes and less government than liberals.  This fact automatically puts the corporations more towards the conservatives.  The voting machines/software/hardware have to be made by someone.  The entities that can most easily do it are corporations.  Let's say for a second that a bunch of hackers got together and made some apparently good software.  Should the software be mistrusted because the hackers tend to be less concerned with laws of society?  Not if it works.  Now, the whole restriction on who can review the raw data, uh-uh, that is bogus.  I can see making the non-corporate personnel signing a non-disclosure agreement about whatever they see in the guts of the machine, but the integrity of the system has to come first.  And not using the full capabilities of the software (thermal imaging to keep track of what part of the screen was touched), why bother having it if you are not going to use it.  My main umbrage was the implied tone of the article that Republicans are pulling all these strings behind the scenes and that we are all evil bastards complicit in the grand conspiracy to make sure we are in control.  I initially thought you sneaked a Salon.com article by me.  I was a little shocked to see that someone in the UK would be that interested in our politics.  Again, Ben, I apologize if you thought my response was directly aimed at you.  I can see why you would think that (since I did use your name in my first sentence), but it really was not.  Now, if you will please excuse me while I attend my weekly strategy meeting for keeping the masses under control....             "

Battery life, of course, depends on individual use. Owners of the original generation of iPods are doing fine on the boards.   i just got off the phone with a representative at Apple.  here's the story: up until literally a  week  ago (!), anyone whose internal iPod battery died had to pay (at the very least)  $250.00  to have the unit serviced, regardless of what was wrong with it; which, of course, is almost as much as buying a new one (they run about 3, 4 and 5 hundred dollars each, depending on the GB).  as you might have guessed, consumers weren't too happy with the cost, so Apple finally relented (as i said, just about 7 days ago), and began offering a 'battery exchange program' for those whose iPod batteries died.  the cost of this service is  $99.00, plus shipping and handling .  to have your battery replaced, you are required to  mail your iPod back to the company , and they may send a replacement unit back instead of your original, depending on their workload.  the nationwide Apple stores cannot replace your battery, and according to the company, neither can the owner; the internal battery is  not  being offered for individual sale by Apple.  a second option is to purchase Apple's 'iPod Protection Plan' for  $59.00 .  this will cover battery replacement for up to 2 years, but you must still send the iPod back to Apple for the same aforementioned service.  after the 2 years of the plan are up, you're back to the $99.00 charge for battery replacement.   despite the company's assertions to the contrary, however, there  is  a non-Apple site that you can buy a replacement iPod internal battery from:  urlLink iPodbattery.com , for about $50 apiece.  they even include online instructions on how to install it, for the  urlLink old  and  urlLink new  models.   average life span of the iPod's internal battery, according to Apple:  1 year with heavy use, 2 years with light use.    it's a brilliant marketing scheme; charge the consumer 3 to 5 hundred dollars for your initial product, and then another hundred bucks every 1-2 years after to keep it running.    i gotta admire them for their chutzpah at the very least, especially with the competition undercutting them by about 50 bucks.  perhaps they figure that the average consumer either won't know any better, or will be unwilling to install the battery themselves...?

"1739",1739,589736,"Aries","           I thought Nick's post was clear and well stated.

I don't really have a response to his suggestions, except they sounded like valid options for debate.  And yes, there certainly are many things that can be done now -- that was my point.  I was just wondering what others thought those should be, as most of what I hear in various media amounts to complaints rather than solutions.  As for handing Iraq over to the UN -- sounds to me like a swift Islamic Fundamentalist state in the making.  Which is what it wants to be, anyway.  All choices being equal, an uninformed populace will take the path of least resistance.  Either the UN's bureaucratic incompetence will set up a fast-track to that result, or the US will spend lots of money, resources, time, and lives on delaying it as long as possible.  The choice, in my layman's opinion, seems not in the destination, which appears predetermined to me, but rather in the journey that gets us there.  Note that I do not consider this fate permanent.  It is merely this generation's path of least resistance.  Revolutionary change takes generations to ripen.  Until then, a populace will suffer any inhumanity in exchange for bread on the shelves and trains that run on time.         "

"1742",1742,589736,"Aries","           JLS: in regards to the protests against Bush's visit to England, you said:    'A shame that 200,000 people organized themselves only to express anger.  Such honest effort and energy expended to no end other than brief catharsis.'   Nick responded to your conclusions.  What did you think of his response?  Do you agree with his take on the protest?    OK, on to the 'Bush unwelcome'. I take the point that a Stop the War protest seems a little pointless about a war that's over, but a) it's not like we were protesting the Boer War or something; there's still shooting and air bombardment going on in Iraq; and b) that wasn't the point of the march anyway.   It was from all kind of angles, but all focusing on Bush and the fact that the 200,000+ people there didn't want to be counted amongst a 'silent majority' welcoming him to Britain and, by extension, tacitly approving his various charming exploits, from Iraq through the clamp-down on civil liberties in the US to 'missile defense', the Kyoto protocol, his stance on the ICC (the International Criminal Court, not the online chess site), illegal holding of prisoners, including British citizens, at Guantanamo Bay and the little fact of his having seized power in the world's most powerful country and our most important ally, with a flagrant disregard for democracy.   It was also a protest against Blair's offering up our country as 'the mother of all photo-ops' (not my phrase - comes from the ex-Foreign Secretary) to the incumbent during his re-election year. As the head of the Labour Party, it seems pretty perverse of our Prime Minister to grant such a PR boost to a pretty extreme Republican administration.    You also said:   'I will repeat the question: What should be done *now*?   Nick responded to this as well: he addressed concerns that people have from many countries, including the US, in regards to Bush's policies in Iraq; it is safe to say that any or all of these issues could and should be addressed immediately.  What is your response to this?  Beyond his list, aren't there a great many other things that can be done now, from changing our tactics in Iraq to overhauling our foreign policy in the middle east overall?    'Oh, yeah, and what to do about Iraq?  Immediate moratorium on any contracts to multinational companies based in any of the invading powers, hand over control to the Arab League with a UN Resolution pledging aid to the restoration of democracy, and invaders to end occupation ASAP.  But I'm just speaking off the top of my head.'    Also, your posts regarding different 'what do i do with  this  flag?' scenarios were clever and hilarious; it helped point out the absurdity of the whole notion that you can make it illegal to burn or otherwise destroy a symbol, which by its very definition cannot truly be destroyed anyway.  Because IT'S A SYMBOL, damnit, NOT the tangible thing that it represents!          "

"1745",1745,589736,"Aries","           My point is not that the Ten Commandments are old, but rather that they were traditionally authored by Yahweh, the god of the Hebrews in the Old Testament, and to refer to them as a starting point in our legal theory is to make inseperable our society's laws and the aforementioned deity.  Such a link would be quite alarming to citizens who do not worship that particular god.  Unlike many other countries, America is not a nation of culture, religion, or kin.  It is a land of immigrants, regardless of who got here first.  Any attempt to establish a connection to a single, unifying religious tradition immediately excludes hundreds, perhaps thousands, of others, and immediately weakens what I consider one of my country's strengths.  The history of human thought is rich and vast, and is more than capable of providing all the justification necessary to hold a society, or a nation, together.  I see no need to choose one artifact from one religion to serve as a back-up for already existing laws.  It is every family's right to display that artifact -- any artifact -- in its own home, or, alternatively, in any private gathering place.  Such an artifact can inspire as much or as little thought or dialogue as the private individual sees fit.  But to place it in a government courthouse suggests, to me, that our laws and the god of the Old Testament are inexorably connected.  And I just can't find a compelling historical, philosophical, or, for that matter, religious reason that it must be so.  Note:  My argument is focusing on the suggested *connection*; I do not feel the judge in question was directly prohibiting the exercise of any particular religion.  Though I doubt he'd mind very much.         "

My non-legal interpretation  It says Congress can't do it.  Somewhere along the way that got put on the states as well (note that I am not proposing that states should be allowed to).  Displaying an item in a public place is not making a law.  Keep in mind that the writer's of the Bill of Rights had fresh memory of English rule where the Anglican Church was the government endorsed religion.  I don't know what, if any, penalties were involved with practicing a different type of Christianity (or judaism or even worse, considering the English history with the Crusades, islam) or being an atheist.  Perhaps Nick could shed some light on it?  The part that always seems to be forgotten is where is says 'or prohibiting the free excercise thereof.'  Going down the path we are heading, churches on major thoroughfares may not be allowed to display their crosses or Christmas nativities because it can be seen from a public street and might be interpreted as the government endorsing a religion by having a road travel right by the church?

I submit to you that we are not 4th century BCE Greeks, therefore the notion of the Republican form of government proposed by Plato (or at least written about by Plato) has no place in today's society.  I may have my information incorrect on Plato, as I don't remember much ancient history, but the specifics are not that important to my point.  Just because a concept is old does not mean it does not have modern relevance.

"1752",1752,589736,"Aries","           In somewhat of an answer to your question Johnathan (in case it was a serious question)  176. Respect for flag No disrespect should be shown to the flag of the United States of America; the flag should not be dipped to any person or thing. Regimental colors, State flags, and organization or institutional flags are to be dipped as a mark of honor.  (a) The flag should never be displayed with the union down, except as a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property.  (b) The flag should never touch anything beneath it, such as the ground, the floor, water, or merchandise.  (c) The flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free.  (d) The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery. It should never be festooned, drawn back, nor up, in folds, but always allowed to fall free. Bunting of blue, white, and red, always arranged with the blue above, the white in the middle, and the red below, should be used for covering a speaker's desk, draping the front of the platform, and for decoration in general.  (e) The flag should never be fastened, displayed, used, or stored in such a manner as to permit it to be easily torn, soiled, or damaged in any way.  (f) The flag should never be used as a covering for a ceiling.  (g) The flag should never have placed upon it, nor on any part of it, nor attached to it any mark, insignia, letter, word, figure, design, picture, or drawing of any nature.  (h) The flag should never be used as a receptacle for receiving, holding, carrying, or delivering anything.  (i) The flag should never be used for advertising purposes in any manner whatsoever. It should not be embroidered on such articles as cushions or handkerchiefs and the like, printed or otherwise impressed on paper napkins or boxes or anything that is designed for temporary use and discard. Advertising signs should not be fastened to a staff or halyard from which the flag is flown.  (j) No part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform. However, a flag patch may be affixed to the uniform of military personnel, firemen, policemen, and members of patriotic organizations. The flag represents a living country and is itself considered a living thing. Therefore, the lapel flag pin being a replica, should be worn on the left lapel near the heart.  (k) The flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning  I do not think the Code has been modified to account for stickers and magnets.  Note that the prefered way is through burning, just not in protest.  I know that many VFW and Foreign Legion Posts hold ceremnonies each year to dispose of flags and that these do involve burning the flag during a somber ceremony.         "

"1756",1756,589736,"Aries","           I liked the idea of that as an offence - maybe that could've been a way out of being burned as a witch.  As a non-American blogger I've been a little reluctant to get involved in some of these discussions, particularly the bits about flags, but since I started it (the subject, not the flag-burning) I suppose I'd better say something.  Firstly, I think that the idea of having a law against flag-burning is completely nuts.  The moment you start according a symbol - any symbol - that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but important step towards totalitarianism.   Symbols are kind of fickle - they don't  a priori  represent anything in themselves; it's what they are perceived as meaning or made to represent that's important.  The flag may represent freedom to you, but that doesn't mean freedom is affected by burning it, any more than terror, torture, coersion and death vanish when it's burned by someone to whom it represents those things.  It follows that you can't just argue against flag-burning by ascribing some meaning to the flag and saying that the flag-burner must dissapprove of this meaning.    ' by doing so [burning the flag], they are saying to me that they do not like the lifestyle the US lets them lead. The lifestyle that allows them to burn the flag without being arrested or shot .'    Couldn't they be saying just about anything about the US?  Maybe they don't like the choice of milkshakes available there.  It's a little unfair to assume that it's the  positive  things they don't like.  And if they're  really  free to do it, why does taking advantage of that freedom in fact imply any protest at all?  By that logic, having gay sex is a protest against a country that grants the freedom to indulge in it.  I'm sure no-one would say, 'by having gay sex, they are saying to me that they do not like the lifestyle the US lets them lead - the lifestyle that allows them to have gay sex without being arrested or shot.' (This might be a bad example to anyone reading in Georgia*) That said, I think there are tactical reasons, as a protestor, to avoid burning flags - be they the Stars'n'Stripes, the Union Jack, the Tricolore or the Star of David - unless you're a citizen of the country that flag represents.  Unless your point really is 'I hate all Americans/British/French/Jews', in any of which cases I'd really rather not be marching alongside you, that's the message you're going to put across to people in that country.   I was pleased to note, on the march against Bush, that almost every banner and speaker was careful to differentiate between GWB and the population he claims to represent.  I would have felt uncomfortable if someone had burned an American flag, because of the indiscriminate message that would put across to people watching in the US (Yeah, like it made the headlines).  I have zero sentimental or political attachment to my country's flag, but I still feel if I see it burned overseas that I probably wouldn't be welcome at that particular party (unless it's one of those 'Hindus For The Abolition of Primary Colors' demonstrations - those guys are alright).  OK, on to the 'Bush unwelcome'.  I take the point that a Stop the War protest seems a little pointless about a war that's over, but a) it's not like we were protesting the Boer War or something; there's still shooting and air bombardment going on in Iraq; and b) that wasn't the point of the march anyway.

"1758",1758,589736,"Aries","           One can only hope that the debunking from AICN towards the bottom of this posting is true.  My apologies in advance for the lengthy copy/paste.  From Dark Horizons:  ******  ...We've heard about Lucas yet again making changes to the original trilogy to update it. Til now most of the rumours have been about adding additional elements like more in regards to Alderaan before its destruction and so on. The gossip reached fever pitch earlier today over the Internet but now it seems the whole fiasco has been defused. Here's the story.  First up the rumours that emerged over at The Digital Bits yesterday:  'These changes include new special effects, revised and updated shots and scenes, and new footage shot with actors Hayden Christensen (Anakin) and Ian McDiarmid (the Emperor) that would flesh out moments with their characters in the original films. For example, an aged and scarred Hayden now appears as Anakin at the end of Return of the Jedi when Luke removes Vader's helmet.   Among the other changes reportedly being made are the restoration of the original 'Han shoots first' moment from Star Wars and a revamped lightsaber fight between Obi-Wan and Vader. What we've heard meshes with what we've been told before, which is that Lucas has always planned to release ultimate, 'Archive' editions of these films that tie in better with the new prequels.   The main question in our minds now is this: will these changes be completed in time to appear on the DVD releases planned for next September, or will we have to wait until after Episode III hits theaters to see them? And if we have to wait, what versions will appear on the DVDs? Time will tell'.  That wasn't the only site with talk of it. TheForce.Net posted an extensive list of all the apparent rumoured changes in order for the original trilogy - 22 for 'A New Hope', 10 for 'Empire' and 14 for 'Jedi'. Amongst musical cue differences and improved lightsaber and spaceship effects there's some big changes here:  'A New Hope' - A new scene which has been shot during the filming of Episode III in which the Emperor dissolves the Senate.  - The bleeding arm on the floor in the Cantina has been replaced with a non-bleeding arm because it's now canon that lightsabers cauterize wounds  - The original Han/Greedo shooting scene has been restored  - When the Death Star destroys Alderaan there's a new scene of Yoda's reaction to the disturbance in the Force that is created by all those deaths and then it cuts to Obi-Wan reacting to it as well  - Temuera Morrison's voice is being recorded for use with all the stormtroopers  - The Obi-Wan/Vader duel has been spruced up. It is much more epic and there is much more movement. A modified version of Duel of the Fates is being considered for the scene  - There's a new scene (shot during Episode III) where Darth Vader goes to Coruscant and lands his ship in the same building Count Dooku does at the end of Attack of the Clones. Except now the building is all fixed up and it is now Palpatine's palace. He meets with Palpatine to ask for forgiveness for his failure and inform him of a new potential who is strong in the Force  'Empire Strikes Back' - Tom-Toms are now CG, the Hoth battle is much more extensive.  - Temuera Morrison's voice is being recorded for the older Boba Fett and all the stormtroopers  - Ian McDiarmid has refilmed scenes as the Emperor. The conversations between Vader and Palpatine is now longer and features a few connections to the prequels  - Yoda's face is now animated in CG allowing more expression of emotions yet his movements remain the same. Also two deleted scenes featuring Yoda instructing Luke have been restored  - A new scene was shot in which the stormtroopers, after they capture Han, Leia and Chewie, bring Vader the box containing C-3PO in pieces. Vader orders the stormtroopers to bring the broken droid to Chewbacca's cell so that he can fix him  'Return of the Jedi' - Jabba, Yoda & the Ewoks are now mostly CG.   - In the battle of Endor there are thousands of Ewoks and they are more vicious than there midgets-in-suits counterparts. More bite the dust now.  - Palpatine's face has gotten a CG lift, the black blotches removed  - Sebastion Shaw who played Anakin when he was unmasked has been replaced with Hayden Christenson in make-up to make him look older. Anakin has much more dialogue. He apologizes for the destruction he caused, he thanks his son for turning him back to the light, he tells his son to rebuild the Jedi and he says he loves him and his sister. Just before he dies he says, 'It is finished...'.  - We see more planets celebrating at the end of the movie. We see an aged Jar Jar, who is now the leader of the Gungans, on Naboo celebrating with the people of Naboo and the Gungans. We see an old Watto, who is now unable to fly, sitting in a hover chair cheering on Tatooine. During these scenes Across the Stars plays transitioning to the victory celebration music at the Ewok tree village.  - Anakin's spirit is now played by Hayden Christenson with make-up to make him look his age. He looks on proudly at his son Luke with the spirit of Padme by his side  The full list can be found here, there's also talk that 'Episode I' will also get a revamp of some sort.  Just a few hours ago though, another site has weighed in - none other than AICN who calls the whole thing an utter fabrication. Here's ' Moriarty':  'I'm going to have to call this one out as being total nonsense. This exact word for word list ran as a talkback by a guy named 'Donnie Darko' several weeks ago, and that's not the first time I've seen it show up. Yes, Lucas is working on Archival Editions of the films, despite his continued denial of it in public, like at a UCLA appearance this week. Yes, there are some dramatic things they're trying. But this fanboy wish list is just not true. And the films that are coming out on DVD next fall are the Special Editions you've seen already. The ones released in '97. No changes. Nothing done to them'          "

"1760",1760,589736,"Aries","           The Ten Commandments are the product of a 13th century BCE religion and culture, regardless of the message, and to place them on government property suggests that we should accept the deity Yahweh, or Jehovah, as our single, original source of law.  As for what is wrong with telling people not to kill, to respect their parents, etc.: nothing.  But what is curious is the need to enhance the already strong argument with the physical presence of the Ten Commandments, which, if one is to take them as merely wise suggestions rather than the direct prescriptives of Yahweh, have no more weight than what anyone else recommends anyway.  The only way that words gain weight, or importance, beyond their inherent meaning, is in either how they are used, or who uses them.  The Ten Commandments, traditionally, come directly from Yahweh through Moses.  Take away that connection, and they have no more weight than any other wisdom.  Are our society's laws so dodgy that we need to back them up with a direct line to the Creator of the universe?  My goodness, but that's an alarming prospect.         "
"1761",1761,589736,"Aries","           Yeah, but then you would have laws passed against attempted flag burning and impersonating a flag  (TIC)         "
"1762",1762,589736,"Aries","           Johnathan - Who said anything about a theocracy?  Would the commandments be better accepted if the one about honor no other God before me (or something to that effect) was not listed?  What is wrong with telling people to not kill one another, respect their parents, don't steal, don't bear false witness against your neighbor, and don't cover your neighbor's possessions?  I seem to recall that most states have laws against taking another's life (except for the State itself with capital punishment).  Of course, if people did not kill others, then the need for capital punishment would be greatly reduced.  Any, the principles expressed in the commandments sound like pretty good fundamentals to live by to me, and totally non-religious in nature if you ignore where they supposedly came from.    Eva - My point with the statues is what point was toppling a statue of Bush supposed to prove?  I really doubt that anyone in the US will be convinced not to vote for Bush because the people in another country don't like him.  Anyone who considers the actions of the protestors in deciding not to vote for Bush will probably have already decided not to based on many other factors.  As for France and Germany, why would they care if you toppled statues or burned their leaders in effigy?  I'm sure 90%+ of their citizens could care less what we in the US think of their leaders.  All I'm saying is that the reverse is true.  (P.S. Thanks for the trivia information on French Fries.  Don't blame me for someone way back thinking that Flemish Fries did not have the same ring.)  If the British don't like the way their PM is buddying up to the US/Bush, then they should do whatever is necessary under the procedures of Parliament to bring down the government.  If the British Parliament is anything like Israel's or Italy's procedurally, then it should not be difficult.  The British protesting our President accomplishes nothing productive.  We are not going to impeach our President because he is unpopular in England.  The last time I checked, we won a war 222 years ago so that we would not have to take orders from them.  Ben - I don't quite understand the difference between how you typed the one sentence (Free speech just does not apply...) compared to what I typed.  To me they say the same thing.  Then again, my degree is in engineering not english.  The point I was trying to make was regardless of the standard that is set for the definition of free speech, it must be applied universally to the socially acceptable topics (Civil rights) and the socially unacceptable topics (white supremacy).  Burning things in peoples yards (i.e. burning a cross in a black family's yard) is not freedom of speech, but a form of intimidation (and probably terrorism under the Patriot Act).  But, a bunch of guys in a farmer's field, with his permission, burning a cross and spouting their hate speech must be accepted as freedom of speech IF we are going to say that burning the flag is.  If a law is passed to make burning the flag illegal, then doing so is no longer a question social acceptability/unacceptability, but strictly legal versus illegal.  If someone, right now, were to burn a flag in front of me, I would not try to have them arrested because he has not violated any law.  What I am saying is that I think that there should be a law against it.  For my part, when I see someone burning a flag in protest, even if I might have been supportive of their cause previously, they have lost my support, and may have even pushed me to be against it depending on what their cause is.  Johnathan - Somewhere back aways, you were asking about other ways of defiling the flag, I think.  When a flag gets old or tattered, there are ceremonies to cover properly destroying the flag.  Under standard flag etiquette, the flag that was on top of the WTC should have been destroyed long ago, but it has now become a different type of symbol all together.         "
"1763",1763,589736,"Aries","           Perhaps one could create a cloth flag that lacks one stripe, or several stars, and set *that* on fire.  It would kind of *look* like the flag, but not really *be* the flag, thus keeping all true flags safe.  One could even market it as the Safe Protest Flag, and sell it at convenience stores.  Or, one could perform a 'Flag Threatening,' in which a protestor holds a flag *close* to an open flame, but does not catch it on fire, thus conveying one's emotion without actual destruction of the object.  Perhaps the apprehension an observer might feel watching such an act would yield the same impact as actual destruction.         "

As I said before, it is extremely ironic that people will chose to burn the symbol of the country that allows them protest peacefully without getting thrown in jail or worse.  '  the irony is interesting, and somewhat intentional, no doubt; but more importantly, the act of burning the flag identifies the protest in question as a serious one, garnering the attention of the public that the protestors are looking for in regards to their cause.  it shows people that they're mad about what our country is doing - so mad, in fact, that they feel like burning their own flag.    ' People will say that burning the flag is an expression of free speech. Hog wash. If burning something is free speech, then the KKK cannot be prosecuted for burning crosses as a symbol of what they believe.  Free speech does not just apply to the things that are considered socially acceptable.  '   assuming you meant to type ' Free speech [just] does not apply to the things that are considered socially acceptable ', tell me, then, if this is what you're saying:   that americans who burn the american flag in a show of protest against US policies should be arrested, because it is socially unacceptable for them to do so, considering they're citizens of a country that lets them protest  without  being arrested.    the definition of what is 'socially acceptable' is just a vague as the definition of 'free speech'; more so, in some cases, given the fact that social standards differ from person to person, city to city, culture to culture... even within the US.    i would daresay that infringing on the rights of others in regards to their own individual pursuit of life, liberty and happiness is unacceptable.  that means i shouldn't be allowed to burn anything on your personal property without your express permission, whether it's a flag or a cross.  doing so on public property, though, is another matter entirely.  that means that *any* group, whether it's white supremisists or dirty hippies, has the right to express themselves in whatever way they see fit, provided their actions do not infringe on the rights of others.  this rule means i could be exposed to plenty of activities and ideas i'm not happy with; but if i am certain of my convictions, they will be made all the stronger via the comparision.    furthermore, ridiculous ideas and beliefs tend to get  stronger  if repressed, not weaker. better to let everything out into the light of day; after a day or so, you'll be able to distinguish between the profound and the poop, via the smell, if you take my meaning.

The best anyone can hope for is to be one of those myriad disparate forces.  A human lifetime is too short a span to allow for complete understanding of long-term change.  My fear is for movements that lack proper perspective.  How many of us recall one isolated incident with our parents that redirected our entire lives for the worse, in some way, leaving a permanent scar?  Yet at that moment, the parent perceived that the action was warranted and appropriate.  It seems to me that wisdom begins with perspective.  And perspective is what the current anti-war movement seems to lack.  A shame, really, because the forces they are protesting -- the hawks of the right -- seem to me, to lack perspective themselves.  Us and Them, targeting issues and each other, firing wide, missing the mark, perpetuating the illusion of dialogue, while History does its own thing in the middle of it all, heedless of the sound and fury.

In America, that feeling is a source of pride.  Yet we disregard Iraqis who feel that way.  Ironic, no?  The current anti-war movement lacks focus, and has not yet produced a clear thesis.  I realize it *thinks* it has, and I acknowledge the thrill and glee of joining a movement, however vague its nature -- but I have yet to hear a clear, compelling manifesto.  Which is a shame, because for all the effort it takes to make and topple a statue, it means nothing without a meaningful message.  I'm sold on the fad, but not the thinking.  A question to the Left:  Assuming that you are correct, that the war was misguided (and I am inclined to agree, to a point), what will it take for the 'movement' to move into the present situation?  Protesting a war that has already happened seems rather silly.  What is the goal -- to get a leader elected who will pull everything *out* of Iraq immediately?  Surely it would be clear to a careful observer that the resulting vacuum would be even worse.  Given that -- what is the *present* strategy of the Left?  What should be done with the *current* situation?  A complete pullout?  Half?  What, exactly?  Assuming the war was wrong -- what should be done *now*?  Assuming our election was a fraud -- what should be done *now*?  Protesting occurs in the present.  Once the protested event is past, the act becomes whining.  An unfortunate, but honest truth.

But more mainstream groups, such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), are also targeted by ALEC as a 'threat,' and the bill would back that up with severe action.   For activists, the danger lies in how A4884 defines 'terrorist' organizations, as 'any association, organization, entity, coalition, or combination of two or more persons with the primary or incidental purpose of supporting any politically motivated activity through intimidation, coercion, fear, or other means.' Activist groups fear that lawful dissent, such as demonstrations, letter-writing campaigns, and leafleting, might fall into any one of those categories, particularly the catchall phrase 'other means.' The bill also seeks to prohibit people from gathering photographic or videotaped evidence of illegal or harmful activities, effectively shutting down the camcorders and other tools used by 21st-century protesters. Additionally, the bill calls for the creation of a state-run website where people convicted of 'eco-terrorism or animal-rights terrorism' would be identified with photographs and stigmatized, much as states do with child molesters.

If rats are infected, it causes slight behavioural changes, thought to increase the chance of transmission.  Well, it causes no behavioural changes in infected cats.  In humans also, there has been no conclusive evidence to show that behaviour is directly affected by the parasite.  They 'evaluate' people's personalities, and then test if they have the disease.  Well, that ends up being a correlational study.  How do you know that people who like cats don't have certain behavioural characteristics already?  Or that people who are more likely to clean litter boxes don't have a certain personality?  Or maybe people who don't clean their houses are more likely to get it since they would be the most likely candidates for rat infestation.  There is no ethical way to show if there is any truth behind the claims that it supposedly has mind-altering effects on humans.  The only way to test for the personality change would be to test their personality before and after infection.  Comparative studies are the only ones that would be scientifically worth anything.

"1821",1821,589736,"Aries","           Oops, good point, Ben - I never said who I was. Hello, everyone, I'm Nick.  My connection is via Eva - she wickedly seduced me one stormy night in Wales and has come to the UK (my homeland) to haunt my every waking hour - and the occasional one when I'm asleep, too.  I'm a stand-up comic by trade (that's what I was doing in Wales. Eva has far less excuse.).  Don't have a website, I'm afraid, but there's a British comedy website called chortle and I'm reviewed/listed  urlLink there .  Just so as not to be completely disregarding recent topics, the situation here in the UK with regards to elections is that you can take time off work to vote - not the whole day, but half a morning or something - and your employer has to let you.  I think that only applies in general elections, though (the big ones where you're voting in a new government [actually it doesn't quite work like that here, but a full explanation would take me too far from the point]).  I don't think it applies for small, local elections - which is a shame, in a way, since those are the ones where your vote counts most and you have more of a chance to really change things. It seems to me that most of our big elections (in both countries) really only afford the public the chance to ratify elite decisions; they keep the population distanced from actual policy formation whilst providing the comforting illusion that our leaders are answerable to us.  On one level they are, of course, since we can vote them out (when we're allowed to every few years) - but really those changes are pretty cosmetic.  I think the limits of the system are shown up in the following hypothesis: Let's say you introduce mandatory voting, so that there's a 95% turnout. The elected government can claim quite a legitimacy with the mandate of a genuine majority of the population. Or it would, if not for the fact that the people are effectively coerced into making the choice. So to avoid this, a 'None of the above' option is introduced. So far, so democratic.  Now, here's the dilemma: What happens if a majority of the voting population goes with the 'None of the above' choice?  Nobody running for power can legitimately take office, since the people have expressed definitely that they don't want the candidates, but you can't just leave the government empty.  What do you do? As far as I can see the system fails at this point. The powers that be can't really allow the electorate a full and comprehensive democratic choice, since there's the risk that people might use it, and that's not really what the electoral system is for.  Of course, there's already the option of not voting, or spoiling your vote, but that's fine provided those choices don't HAVE to be interpreted as 'None of the above'.  And to be honest, often a more realistic interpretation of not voting might be, 'Mmmmm... My bed's comfy.' Oops. A bit of a rant. Did Eva warn you about my tendency to do that?  To recap: 1. Hello, everybody, nice to meet you. and 2. I read too much Chomsky.         "

What's the lowdown? --Jerry M., Los Angeles    urlLink Dear Jerry:   History records no observation of Christmas before 354, and by that time there was no one around who remembered exactly when Jesus was born. Today, historians have all but given up trying to figure it out. They give his birth date as 6-8 BC (good trick, but this was no ordinary dude) and leave it at that.  Nobody knows exactly why Christ's birthday is celebrated on December 25. One theory holds that this is the right date, postulating that Zachary was high priest and that the Day of Atonement fell on September 24, ergo, John the Baptist was born on June 24 and Christ dropped in exactly six months later on December 25. Modern scholars use this theory to get laughs at cocktail parties.   Another guess works backward from the supposed date of the crucifixion (March 25), figuring that Christ was conceived exactly 33 years before he died, True Believers having no use for fractional numbers. According to the most tenable hypothesis, Christ's birthday was assigned to the winter solstice (December 25 in the Julian calendar, January 6 in the Egyptian) because the date had a ready-made pagan holiday, the 'Birthday of the Invincible Sun' (or 'ancient Saturnalia debauch,' as you put it).  The idea that Jesus was a Pisces probably comes from the characterization of that sign as one of spiritualism, humility, compassion, sacrifice, etc. Students of astrology will tell you it's not kosher to work the formula backwards that way.

"1854",1854,589736,"Aries","           WHITE HOUSE COVERS TRACKS BY REMOVING INFORMATION  In a high-tech cover-up, the Washington Post this morning reports the White House is actively scrubbing government websites clean of any of its own previous statements that have now proven to be untrue. Specifically, on April 23, 2003, the president sent his top international aid official on national television to reassure the public that the cost of war and reconstruction in Iraq would be modest. USAID Director Andrew Natsios, echoing other Administration officials, told Nightline that, 'In terms of the American taxpayers contribution, [$1.7 billion] is it for the US. The American part of this will be $1.7 billion. We have no plans for any further-on funding for this.'  The president has requested more than $166 billion in funding for the war and reconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan this year. But instead of admitting that he misled the nation about the cost of war, the president has allowed the State Department 'to purge the comments by Natsios from the State department's Web site. The transcript, and links to it, have vanished.' (The link where the transcript existed until it caused embarrassment was  urlLink www.usaid.gov/iraq/nightline ).  When confronted with the dishonest whitewash, the administration decided to lie. A Bush spokesman said the administration was forced to remove the statements because, 'there was going to be a cost' charged by ABC for keeping the transcript on the government's site. But as the Post notes, 'other government Web sites, including the State and Defense departments, routinely post interview transcripts, even from 'Nightline,'' and according to ABC News, 'there is no cost.'  This story is not the first time the President has tried to hide critical information from the American public. For instance, the president opposed the creation of the independent 9/11 investigative commission, and has refused to provide the commission with critical information, even under threat of subpoena. Similarly, after making substantial budget cuts, the president ordered the government to stop publishing its regular report detailing those cuts to states. And when confronted with a continuing unemployment crisis, the president ordered the Department of Labor to stop publishing its regular mass layoff report.  It is also not the first time the administration has sought to revise history and public records when those records become incriminating. As the Post reports 'After the insurrection in Iraq proved more stubborn than expected, the White House edited the original headline on its Web site of President Bush's May 1 speech, 'President Bush Announces Combat Operations in Iraq Have Ended,' to insert the word 'Major' before combat.' And the 'Justice Department recently redacted criticism of the department in a consultant's report that had been posted on its Web site.'  Read the  urlLink Mis-Lead .         "

Asked about the emphasis now on alleged weapons 'programs' instead on possession of weapons themselves, Bush remained firm about his prewar assessment of the threat Saddam posed and insisted the world and America are safer because of the war that toppled him.   ' What's the difference? ' he said. 'If he were to acquire weapons, he would be the danger. That's what I'm trying to explain to you. A gathering threat, after 9-11, is a threat that needed to be dealt with.'    ...i guess the difference that immediately comes to mind would be the one between 1) telling the truth  and 2) lying.    what the fuck, bush?  is  that  the administration's answer to why we haven't found any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq?  that you figured we'd understand that when you  urlLink said  right before the war, 'The dictator of Iraq and his weapons of mass destruction are a threat to the security of free nations',  what you *meant* was, 'The dictator of Iraq is  planning  on producing weapons of mass destruction at some point in future, which  at that time  will be a threat to the security of free nations?'  added bonus: he managed to drop a 9-11 reference into a discussion about the justification for invading Iraq.    dammit to hell; enough of this.  i never expected to agree with the bush administration's policies, but the very least they could do is be straightforward with the people who pay their salaries.

If people are feeling confident in their wallets, the incumbent generally has no problems.  Ben - So we should not have tracked him down, left the country, and let him resume control?  Reports on the news are that most of the attacks are being carried out by Hussein loyalists, Al Queda, or jihadists, not the normal citizens who were brutalized by Hussein.  I have not seen any smug comments for the Republicans, only satisfaction from the military commanders.  That's not to say there won't be, but I have not seen any yet.  As far as WMD, at this point I don't think anyone thinks they will be found.  We can debate from here to eternity about whether or not they ever existed, whether they were smuggled out of the country before the invasion, and whether we were intentionally misled by the President, or if he was misinformed by the intelligence aparatus.  We don't know and probably never will know the certain truth.  You'll believe what you want and I'll believe what I want.           "

"1887",1887,589736,"Aries","           Eva - Perhaps you could explain to me why a single cent of the $20 billion dollars the  US is paying  for reconstruction should go to any country that opposed the _____ (insert your preferred term for the action taken).  If France, Germany, or Russia wish to pony up their own money to reconstruct things and get their contractor's to do so, then let them.  But, as I understand the basis of their arguements, they are upset that we won't let their contractor's bid on projects being paid for with US (and maybe UK?) money.  Mir - Some?  Yes.  Enough to do the job in the near future?  Doubtful.  In my dealing with Contractor's, I have found most of them to be so tight that they squeak and that they claim not to have two pennies to rub together.  So, odds are, except for management and certain ultraskilled positions, they will probably hire Iraqi's to do alot of the work as a cost savings method.  If you bring over your American crews, you need to pay much more (travel and housing) versus using someone local.  I hope and think that most contractor's will do that (see, greed is not always bad)  As far as the medical question goes, your conservative comment seems to imply that you think only conservatives are rich and powerful.  I recall a survey, several years old now, that was looking at the net worth of U.S. Senators.  You might be surprised to learn that there were more Democratic millionaires than Republican.  I honestly don't remember if was a 45 to 40 thing or a 10 to 5, but that is not my point.  There are quite a few rich powerful liberals that aren't champoining these causes either.  Also, do you think that no research is being done on either of the two diseases you specifically mentioned?  Angie can correct me here if I am wrong, but I think that fibro was only recently (last 3-5 years) actually classified as a disease.  I don't think you can expect too much research on a disease most doctors don't know even exists.  I would expect that research is underway now.  As for autisim, I know that research is being done.  There has been some recent finding that some medium used to prepare or administer childhood vaccinations has a mercury compound in it.  There appears to be some connection between the that and autism.  It must be a recent finding, because in 2000, nothing was said about this to us when Katherine got her immunizations, but everytime we get a shot for the twins, it is included in the information given to us.  It does make me ask the question, what is worse - losing your child to mumps, rubella, or polio or having them permanenetly disabled by the prevention?  That's not a choice I really want to make.  Keep in mind that there is only one pot of money for medical research, currently provided by both the public and private sector.  That money has to be divided up amongst AIDS, cancer, MS, heart disease, paralysis and a myriad of other diseases/conditions that I did not mention.  I have much more faith in the private sector to get the most out of this finite pot of money than I do the government.  I have worked for the government and currently work with government programs.  The bureaucratic BS and innefficiencies are maddening.  Money is held up because a form was not filled out 100% correctly or because some Congressman has not had his chance to make a press release about getting the money for his district.  At least with the private sector, they want to get breakthroughs so they can get the return on their investment.  It really is sad that someone is going to benefit from someone else's suffering, but I can't think of a better motivator, since there are very few people in this world who are solely devoted to the relief of suffering (like Mother Teresa was).

"1894",1894,589736,"Aries","           Johnathan - I agree with the similarities between 2004 and 1996 with regards to the motivations of the political parties.  One difference I see is what happened in the 1994 and 2002 mid-tem elections.  Historically, the party out of power gains seats in Congress in the mid-terms.  In 1994, that paragon of virtue (tic) Newt Gingrich managed to energize the Republicans on a national level to take back the House for the first time in 40 or so years.  He then of course proceeded to blow his momentum and hand Clinton the White House in 1996 through a number of missteps.  Fast forward to 2002, and Gephardt (sp?) was banking on retaking control of the House and firming control of the Senate.  Instead, the House remainined in Republican control and the Senate went back to the Republicans.  What does that mean for the upcoming election?  Probably not a damn thing, but it is a difference.  I do have to laugh at the Democrats first harping on the fact the Iraq was going to be a military disaster, which it was not.  Then they latched on to the economy being terrible, but now it is recovering very nicely.  So now they are back to Iraq and the post 'war' efforts and saying we need to get things under control.  But, I am not hearing many solutions, just pointing out the problems, which I fully agree are there.  Angie - Thanks, that makes me much less afraid of Dean.  I did not know he is a doctor.  I have not heard any of Dean's details on the medical front and will not pay attention to them unless and until he becomes the actual nominee.  But, one concern I have of government mandates on things like insurance and medicine, is that it smacks of socialism.  Canada has socialized medicine.  Everyone is covered and the quality of care is good from what I have witnessed.  The problem is with availability of some forms of treatment.  My mother, who handles the insurance for her doctor's office and has many chronic ailments (lupus, arthritis), told me the waiting list for heart catheterization is about 18 months in Canada.  The problem is, when someone needs that procedure, they need it pretty much imediately.  Most people don't survive 18 months, so they travel to the US and pony up the cash to have it done here.  I guess my point is, for right or wrong, profit is what drives most things in this country.  The insurance companies and doctors have to be able to profit from their work or they will do something else, creating a shortage.  I will be curious to see how he addressed this in Vermont.  If the government steps in much further, I am afraid that our medical system will be hurt severly.  Case in point of the profit driven results is Viagra.  I'm sure that there were many other diseases/conditions that Pfizer could have researched besides male impotence.  But, look at the original target 'audience' - Middle Aged White Males.  They knew that they would be able to make a proverbial killing from the general affluence of that market.  In the meantime, research into chronic illnesses go underfunded or totally unresearched.  Mir - I would hope that we will utilize Iraqis as much as possible.  However, given the magnitude of the problems that need to be addressed, I doubt that they have the numbers and/or specialties necessary to do it all.  If we are talking road and bridge work, I would assume that the Iraqis have the ability to do those.  But, if we are talking about updating the electrical system nationwide, they probably don't.  Heck, given what happened here over the summer, you could say that neither the US or Canada do either.         "
"1895",1895,589736,"Aries","           i think that most of the work to build up iraq should be given to iraqi companies or/and as many iraqis as possible should be employed for these projects.         "
"1896",1896,589736,"Aries","           Answer from Ever-so-slightly-left-of-the-middle:  Though Dean's stance is to be as anti-Bush as possible, if you actually listen to him in his speeches and campaigning, he's really not that leftist.  He is about Bush (but not necessarily Iraq), and he is about health care (because he's a doctor).  But in terms of gun control, abortion, the environment, blah blah blah, he's really no more left that the other candidates, if not leaning a little more towards moderate in such areas.  And I think he's a fiscal conservative as well.  He just likes to talk Bush-smack to get people all fired up, even if some of their non-foreign policy political ideologies are not so deeply divided.  That's just what I gleaned from watching him the few times that I have...I just like him because of his health care reform.  Being that I'm a non-senior-citizen with a disability, there aren't a lot of options for people like me, and I like his ideas on how to fix that.  *shrugs*  Bush-smack sounds...dirty.  Sorry.         "
"1897",1897,589736,"Aries","           Answer from the Middle:  Dean's status in the polls is founded entirely on an anti-Bush movement.  Ironically, the Left's motivation for this election -- we hate Bush, we gotta get rid of this man -- is very reminiscent of the Right's motivation in the Clinton era.  Both sides -- the Right, then, and the Left, now -- lacked, and lack, a vision, a plan, a drive to execution.  At 9/11, the Right reacted quickly with a vision and a plan, while the Left sputtered and blew the moment.  Now the Left can only play catch-up, and the only thesis on the table is getting rid of Bush.  The Left needs a vision, a plan, and a reliable leader to initiate the march -- one who won't throw it all away on a cigar and a beret.  Until that happens, they will flail about in vague, yet honest, frustration and anger.  For now, the Right has the money and the product:  Fear sells, and everybody's buying.         "

On a funny note, Dean is aparently raising most of his money via the internet.  If that is the case, he owes Al Gore two thank yous.  First for the endorsement.

"1900",1900,589736,"Aries","           Well, since I am the only one on the right remaining on the blog, I'll give you my opinion.  As with most things, if you want to get a good idea of an entities reasoning for taking an action, follow the money.  I saw many pieces of infomration back in January and February listing the reasons behind France's, Germany's, and to a lesser extent Russia's opposition to the then proposed military actions against Iraq.  They were the top three countries in oil exploration and refining in Iraq, violating many of the UN sanctions against Iraq.  They knew that any change in the government of Iraq would likely cost them those lucrative contracts, rights, and infrastructure.  So they opposed it.  I'll try to locate the information I saw back then and post it here.  Now they are complaining that we won't let them benefit again on the backs of the Iraqi's.  Additionally, I would bet, but don't know for sure, that the money for this work is coming from the US and maybe the UK.  Why would either country want to give this money to someone else who opposed the action to begin with?  Childish?  Most definitely, but it is reality.  Now, if you can show me some work that a) will not be done in a timely fashion because there are not enough companies to do the work or b) only a company from one of those countries is qualified to do, I will have a problem with it.  Otherwise, you reap what you sow.  As an add on to b), the only thing that I comes to mind right off hand is nuclear material clean up.  France would be good at this since they provide a large percentage of their power through nuclear power, and are pretty good at dealing with the waste.  But, since Iraq does not have a nuclear program, I guess that rules that possibility out.         "

"1908",1908,589736,"Aries","           Note that in the monitors, the previous Neos all look the same.  Three possibilities:  (1) this is an illustrative image by the filmmakers, to show that the previous anomalies were variations of a single effect, though of course they could not be the same physical body -- which means the monitors are there for either the audience's benefit or Neo's:  ours, in that we need to have this concept presented graphically, or Neo's, in that the Architect is artificially recreating Neo's face to show what the previous anomalies have done, though they would have to have been historically different, unique physical individuals; (2) all anomalies, for some reason, assume within the matrix the physical appearance of what would be the 6th anomaly, i.e., simplisticly, the appearance of Keanu Reeves; or (3) the body of the single individual who represents the anomaly -- to simplify again, Keanu Reeves -- continues to be liberated from and reinserted into the matrix; thus, what we witness at the end could be what has happened five times before:  the physical body returns to the Source, possibly to be placed once again into a stasis pod.  Which means that Neo -- again, the physical body of Keanu Reeves -- has now experienced *six* violent liberations from his physical stasis pod.  In this way, the cycle repeats not only within the Matrix, but in the physical world, as well.         "
"1909",1909,589736,"Aries","            The Architect  - Hello, Neo.   Neo  - Who are you?   The Architect  - I am the Architect. I created the matrix. I've been waiting for you. You have many questions, and although the process has altered your consciousness, you remain irrevocably human. Ergo, some of my answers you will understand, and some of them you will not. Concordantly, while your first question may be the most pertinent, you may or may not realize it is also irrelevant.   Neo  - Why am I here?   The Architect  - Your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation inherent to the programming of the matrix. You are the eventuality of an anomaly, which despite my sincerest efforts I have been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise a harmony of mathematical precision. While it remains a burden to sedulously avoid it, it is not unexpected, and thus not beyond a measure of control. Which has led you, inexorably, here.   Neo  - You haven't answered my question.   The Architect  - Quite right. Interesting. That was quicker than the others.  *The responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors*  Others?  What others?  How many?  Answer me!'    The Architect  - The matrix is older than you know. I prefer counting from the emergence of one integral anomaly to the emergence of the next, in which case this is the sixth version.  *Again, the responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors*   Five versions?   Three?   I've been lied too.   This is bullshit!    Neo : There are only two possible explanations: either no one told me, or no one knows.   The Architect  - Precisely. As you are undoubtedly gathering, the anomaly is systemic, creating fluctuations in even the most simplistic equations.  *Once again, the responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors*   You can't control me! Fuck you!  I'm going to kill you!  You can't make me do anything!    Neo  - Choice. The problem is choice.  * The scene cuts to Trinity fighting an agent, and then back to the Architect's room *   The Architect  - The first matrix I designed was quite naturally perfect. It was a work of art, flawless, sublime.  A triumph equaled only by its monumental failure. The inevitability of its doom is as apparent to me now as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human being. Thus, I redesigned it based on your history to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature.   However, I was again frustrated by failure. I have since come to understand that the answer eluded me because it required a lesser mind, or perhaps a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection. Thus, the answer was stumbled upon by another, an intuitive program, initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche. If I am the father of the matrix, she would undoubtedly be its mother.   Neo  - The Oracle.   The Architect  - Please. As I was saying, she stumbled upon a solution whereby nearly 99.9% of all test subjects accepted the program, as long as they were given a choice, even if they were only aware of the choice at a near unconscious level. While this answer functioned, it was obviously fundamentally flawed, thus creating the otherwise contradictory systemic anomaly, that if left unchecked might threaten the system itself. Ergo, those that refused the program, while a minority, if unchecked would constitute an escalating probability of disaster.   Neo  - This is about Zion.   The Architect  - You are here because Zion is about to be destroyed. Its every living inhabitant terminated, its entire existence eradicated.   Neo  - Bullshit.  *The responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors*   Bullshit!    The Architect  - Denial is the most predictable of all human responses. But, rest assured, this will be the sixth time we have destroyed it, and we have become exceedingly efficient at it.  * Scene cuts to Trinity fighting an agent, and then back to the Architect's room. *   The Architect  - The function of the One is now to return to the source, allowing a temporary dissemination of the code you carry, reinserting the prime program. After which you will be required to select from the matrix 23 individuals: 16 female, 7 male, to rebuild Zion. Failure to comply with this process will result in a cataclysmic system crash killing everyone connected to the matrix, which coupled with the extermination of Zion will ultimately result in the extinction of the entire human race.   Neo  - You won't let it happen, you can't. You need human beings to survive.   The Architect  - There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept. However, the relevant issue is whether or not you are ready to accept the responsibility for the death of every human being in this world.  *The Architect presses a button on a pen that he is holding, and images of people from all over the matrix appear on the monitors*   The Architect  - It is interesting reading your reactions. Your five predecessors were by design based on a similar predication, a contingent affirmation that was meant to create a profound attachment to the rest of your species, facilitating the function of the one. While the others experienced this in a very general way, your experience is far more specific. Vis-a-vis, love.  *Images of Trinity fighting the agent from Neo's dream appear on the monitors*   Neo  - Trinity.   The Architect  - Apropos, she entered the matrix to save your life at the cost of her own.   Neo  - No!   The Architect  - Which brings us at last to the moment of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw is ultimately expressed, and the anomaly revealed as both beginning, and end. There are two doors. The door to your right leads to the source, and the salvation of Zion. The door to the left leads back to the matrix, to her, and to the end of your species. As you adequately put, the problem is choice.   But we already know what you're going to do, don't we? Already I can see the chain reaction, the chemical precursors that signal the onset of emotion, designed specifically to overwhelm logic, and reason. An emotion that is already blinding you from the simple, and obvious truth: she is going to die, and there is nothing that you can do to stop it.  *Neo walks to the door on his left*   The Architect  - Hmph. Hope. It is the quintessential human delusion, simultaneously the source of your greatest strength, and your greatest weakness.   Neo  - If I were you, I would hope that we don't meet again.   The Architect  - We won't.          "
"1910",1910,589736,"Aries","           Two cents:  I think the machines kept Neo alive for fear that if he died, another One would appear and the cycle would repeat.  Same with why they chose not to destroy Zion -- because inevitably the cycle would repeat, and they'd have to do it again.  The Oracle allowed Smith to absorb her so that she could help Neo when he confronted Smith in the final battle; she was left behind when Smith was destroyed.  Speaking for yelahneb:  Ben's theory is that Neo has been altered with cyborg-like implants that allow him to connect with the machines.  I'm not satisfied with this interpretation, but I haven't come up with anything more satisfying myself.  In general, it seemed to me that the goal was not victory/defeat (1 or 0), but the breaking of a cycle: something that was neither 1 nor 0.         "

"1930",1930,589736,"Aries","           If you move past the debate of whether or not the project is needed or if the benefits out weigh the costs/impacts, then we design the projects with human safety as the number one criteria.  The FAA has specific requirements for the grades (steepness) of runways, taxiways and the areas surrounding them to provide a safe operational environment.  Local, state, and Federal requirements then dictate that the designs be accomplished with the smallest amount of impcat to waters of the US, wetlands, and forests (especially in Maryland - the tree is as holy as cows are in India).  It all ends up being a balancing act of safe environment, limited environmental impacts, and minimizing costs (which are 95% funded by the FAA).  In the end, the owner usually does not have too much input on the specifics of how something is done, after all that is what they are paying me for.  They just want their new runway (in this case) and leave the details to us.  To answewr your question, we go to the middle ground as much as possible, if for no other reason than it is legally required.  If I did not have these restrictions, my job would be much easier, but also way more boring.    It is kind of funny because in WWII there were alot of airfield constructed.  In Virginia alone Norfolk, Richmond, Newport News, Roanoke, Suffolk, Franklin, West Point, Emporia, Petersburg, Accomack, and Danville were all constructed in the early 1940's.  For the most part these were built by the Army on swamp land.  Today, they would never be built, because of all the wetland (swamp) impacts.  The group that oversees wetlands?  The US Army Corps of Engineers.  How's that for irony?         "

At least sites/organizations like Salon and Rush Limbaugh are honest about their view of things.   urlLink The press' representation of the public hearing I presented at on Monday   Now, there is nothing untrue in the article.  But, it leaves the impression that there was only dissent.  There were 5 speakers - 1 (Mr. Wilmont) expressed environmental concerns, 1 (Mr. McHaffey) expressed concerns about property value and noise, the other 3 were speaking in favor of the project.  Mr. Wilmont's comments were well expressed and received (unlike some public hearings I have attended where people were ranting and raving), and his comments are acurately and fully presented in the article.  Mr. McHaffey was more concerned with the rezoning of his property from residential to industrial in the past couple of years.  He has consistently (for the last 6 years anyway) complained about helicopter noise.  The proposed development will neither add to nor subtract from the helipcopter operations.  Again, while nothing printed is untrue of what he said, the emphasis of his comments is misrepresented.  Given the title of the article, you would think that nothing positive was said on the hearing.  There were 3 people speaking in favor of the project, and 4 of the 5 Commissioner's (same as Supervisors in Virginia) had positive comments and expectations resulting from the proposed expansion.  The last Commissioner did not comment.  My point is this.  If the press can misrepresent something relatively simple with a negative tilt, how much do they get wrong on issues where people don't know the details?  Reporters are supposed to report the facts and leave the opinions for the editorial page.  Not presenting the whole truth, in my opinion, is the same as stating your own opinions in a news story.           "

"1950",1950,589736,"Aries","           Greetings from Zagreb!  Thought it would be fun to post from a little further away than usual.  I'm in Zagreb, Croatia, where I did a gig last night (this is a pretty jet-setting time for me - I'm in Berlin in a few days).  It was my first time doing a gig to an audience who predominantly spoke English only as a second or third language.  Very interesting.  They were fine with most of the references (Bush, Iraq, Tony Blair, Harry Potter) and highly amused that my surname means 'poo' in the country of my betrothed.  The Bosnia/Croatia war was a no-go area, since Britain and France opposed Croatia's independence (I knew John Major would one day try to ruin a gig for me) and I think they were a little taken aback by my take on Catholicism, but it was a great night and felt really historic.  This is Croatia's first attempt at starting stand-up comedy and it was only their second show.  It's weird - I've never been shown actually doing my act on TV in Britain but in Croatia it took exactly one night.  Today I walked around Zagreb for about 3 hours.  It's a really beautiful city and has pretty much recovered from the war, cosmetically at least (socially, they have that World Bank/IMF thing going on: 5 per cent of the population is filthy rich and 40 per cent are below the poverty line).  Anyway, I've enjoyed being here immensely and thought I'd share.  The home page of the PC in my hotel is a hardcore porn site, which maybe isn't surprising for a Catholic country still in the throes of post-Communist freedom.  Nick         "

"1961",1961,589736,"Aries","           Gusev Crater, Tarus 23, XXVI (MPI) -- A spokesthing for Mars Air Force denounced as false rumors that an alien space craft crashed in the desert, outside of Ares Vallis on Saturday.   Appearing at a press conference today, General Rgrmrmy The Lesser stated that 'the object was, in fact, a harmless high-altitude weather balloon, not an alien spacecraft'.   The story broke late Saturday night when a major stationed at nearby Ares Vallis Air Force Base contacted the Gusev Crater Daily Record with a story about a strange, balloon-shaped object which allegedly came down in the nearby desert, 'bouncing' several times before coming to a stop, and 'deflating in a sudden explosion of alien gases.'   Minutes later, General Rgrmrmy contacted the Daily Record telepathically to contradict the earlier report. General Rgrmrmy stated that hysterical stories of a detachable vehicle roaming across the Martian desert were blatant fiction, provoked by incidences involving swamp gas. But the general public has been slow to accept the Air Force's explanation of recent events, preferring to speculate on the 'other-worldly' nature of the crash debris. Conspiracy theorists have condemned Rgrmrmy's statements as evidence of 'an obvious government cover-up,' pointing out that Mars no longer has any swamps.   They point to the release of secret government memos detailing attempts to discredit reports of the landings by alien space craft.   Local residents, like Driv Rhodo, who lives in the area of the alleged landings, are even more skeptical. 'I seen it with my own 5 eyes' claimed Rhodo last week. 'I've lived here over 300 years, most of my adult life-form. Them things used to be few and far between but lately they come in every few years or so. The government wants to bury the truth but I can tell you what's real. The Earthlings are going to invade and the government is spending our hard earned tax dollars on press releases and denials instead of preparing for the battle to come.'   A spokesthing denied any government involvement in the disappearance of Rhodo, who has not been seen since shortly after the interview, claiming 'Any sentient being knows that a planet with the concentrations of water and oxygen found on Earth is a deadly and inhospitable environment for the formation of life, much less intelligent life. The fear and consternation caused by the unfounded and wild speculations of citizens like Rhodo are a traitorous disservice to the citizens of Mars.'           "
"1962",1962,589736,"Aries","           I listened to about 15 minutes of the State of the Union last night while driving home (which means I heard about 1 minute of speaking and 14 minutes of Republicans standing and clapping).  Forgetting the topic of the exchange for a minute, I did hear a funny thing.  Bush was talking about the expiration of the 'let's get all the dirt we can on everyone and imprison people without due process' act.  He paused for some reason, probably dramatic effect.  At which point there was a smattering of applause from who I assume were Democrats.  Then he continued and said that the terrorist threat would not expire on the same deadline, which of course got a tremendous round of applause.  I saw a replay of that portion of the tape this morning.  He definitely enjoyed that little 'gotcha' moment.  And, like I said, ignoring the topic it surrounded for a moment, it was kind of funny.  Other than that, as much as I like politics, I can't stand the State of Union address.  It never really amounts to more than a chance for politicians to put on a public show of what they are for and against.  The party in power will say that it was a great speech.  The party out of power will say it failed to discuss the really important issues.  Instead, we watched a rerun of Early Edition on PAX.         "

One, it was very reminiscent of a relationship that I was once in.  Two, as an actor currently studying acting, I was fascinated by the performances and their varying techniques/approaches to their characters/styles, etc.  Their work was all so intimate that I almost felt voyueristic watching it at times, especially Bill Murray.  And I thought it was a beautiful story about a remarkable connection between two people.  That human quality is something I enjoy in movies...  3)  I thank God that taste changes over time, or I'd still be listening to my 'Rainbow Brite' LP about 50 times a day.  I agree with Johnathan that the tastes in almost anything (food, music, activities, films, etc.) that I've 'outgrown,' so to speak, will always hold a nostalgic value for me, even if I don't engage in them with any frequency anymore.  4)  Comfort is my new favorite restaurant...FRIED OKRA!!!  5)  Today was my first day of classes, and while I'm excited about the resurgence of productivity in my daily schedule, it absolute whooped my fibro-ridden ass.

"1966",1966,589736,"Aries","           That's interesting Johnathan.  In regards to music I have an eclectic taste.  I like the rock music of the 70's and 80's since they represent a much simpler and generally more enjoyable time of my life (nostalgia).  I can't stand most of today's music, partly based on lyrics/topics and partly based on the music itself.  I love big band music (Glenn Miller, Benny Goodman, et. al) probably because I played alot of that in the jazz bands I was in in high school and college.  But for straight artistry, I love classical music (in the general definition of orchestral music).  Bach, Beethoven Tchaichovsky, Mussorgsky, Rossini, Copland, Wagner, Gershwin, even some Bernstein, and on and on.  When I get a chance and have had a stressful day or week, I lay flat on my back in front of the speakers and listen to some of this music, lose myself in the intricacies of the music and end up feeling much more relaxed and focused.  Sorry for drifting off topic there, but my point was that I had never thought about the fact that my taste in music has not changed much over the years and how that relates to heart and mind.  That would be an interesting study (what do changes in taste of art reflect on the growth of person?)  I bet some doctoral candidate has studied that at some point.         "

It's probably more accurate to say what I 'like' changes over time, while what I admire or value remains the same.  I will always admire and value the craft and artistry of Pink Floyd.  But I rarely listen to them anymore.  When I do, I find I'm only visiting old stomping grounds.  The appeal is only in appreciation of craft and nostalgia for a time or place.  I am grateful for what they gave me at that time, but I now go to other sources for meaning or sustenance.  That said, I experience my changes in preference as a slow continuum.

"1972",1972,589736,"Aries","           Miriam -- From my observation of your reactions to movies and music over the years, I think it's safe to say that content is the key for you.  If the content doesn't connect, you won't like the film.  In that sense, it seems likely that you prefer either filmed essays or escapist tales.  There's nothing wrong with this; it's just seems to be how you relate to the arts.  That said, I suspect that Lost in Translation did not get you because the content wasn't engaging.  Because without the content, I feel there is plenty of evidence throughout that it is still a strong example of storytelling, character exploration, and filmcraft.  It seems to me that you approach the arts as a seeker -- a seeker of either ideas or entertainment -- rather than as an aesthete.  There is nothing invalid about approaching a work solely as a seeker; but the more personal the quest, the more limited the experience.  As for myself, the film connected profoundly with me, both personally and aesthetically.  I suspect that the film's content did not resonate with any aspect of your own personal search, and was promptly (and validly, for you) dismissed in all remaining categories.         "

"1974",1974,589736,"Aries","           Nick - According to the book, what was the most scandalous thing going on?  I don't have time to read much anymore, and have never really read any non-fiction political books.  I only point to the vote counting since that is what the two rulings from the Supreme Court were about and the origin of the 'Selected, not Elected' mantra that Jesse Jackson and others continue to throw out.  I read part of the Greg Palast link.  If that is part of what you are referring to, then I would have to ask about the military absentee ballots that were discarded because they did not have post marks?  While certainly not a monolithic block ,the majority of military votes got to the Republicans.  These soldiers were serving in Bosnia and Saudi Arabia and Korea, but their votes were discarded because of a technicality of the military postal system.  There is no fool proof system.  To assert that the incompetence / laziness of the company (IBT?) was deliberate a full 7 months in advance of the election assigns them the power of clairvoiance to know that the election was going to be decided by the extremely close margin it was.  There is also the assumption that all of the people that were scrubbed (terrible word IMO) would have a) voted and b) voted for Gore (and not Bush or any of the other 5 or 6 candidates).  I don't think you will find many people who live in the real world that think that the 2000 election nationwide, not just in Florida, was unflawed.  There was the judge in St. Louis who ordered the polls to remain open 3 or 4 hours longer in one area for a reason that I can't recall.  That area just happened to be a largely black area and one where the Democrats were going door to door to get people to go vote.  There was also the 'math error' that led the networks to call Florida before the polls has closed.  It is impossible to know how many, if any, people in the panhandle, a largely Republican area, did not bother to vote because of this announcement.  Then there was the voter incompetence in Palm Beach(?) where the people did not know how to read the ballot.  The ballot they used there was the same type used in Chesterfield, and it was 100% clear to me.  It was a mess.  Back to a conversation from many months ago, I think many of the problems (election wise) would be solved if our participation in the process was increased. 50% for the presidential election is downright pathetic.  The reason I think it would be solved is that I think the Democrats would win handily as they have done a better job of selling class warfare (rich vs. poor) and convincing the 'working class' that the government is the answer to everything when compared to the Republican belief that less governemnt is better.  The Democrats message sells better if you don't dig into it, so it would win.  Count me as one of the yays on the legitimacy of the election.  I have no idea on the commission.  Who was supposed to running it?         "

About the militarisation of space, I agree with John that it looks like being inevitable at this point - not that I think we should be happy with that.  That NASA is the mechanism via which the public can be made to fund military research is nothing new, either.  Most high technology, from telecoms to nuclear weapons, is a result of public subsidies. The main  raison d'etre  of the Pentagon system was to set up this system. Once the public has paid the cost, the technology gets turned over to private enterprise to collect the profits (I believe the term for this is 'free enterprise').  And if the private enterprise gets in trouble, the public bails them out. Yay! Risk-free capitalism!   We have satellites and computers because the Pentagon and NASA covered for it (in the US - we have our own versions too, of course.  I think Alan Turing got military funding, for instance, although don't quote me.). These things are now profitable, so they get handed over to big private corporations.  This is an open secret - it's not talked about much in public, since most people don't like it when they realise they're paying to make rich people even richer, and effectively underwriting any risk, but on the other hand it needs to be known in the right sectors because, well, companies have to know where their free money's coming from.  urlLink  'This transfer between public and private industry is called Spinoff at NASA.'   The Bush stealing the election thing...  It's funny how every pro-Bush comment I ever read focuses on ballot-counting and chads, as though those were the most scandalous things going on.  The best book I've read on the Florida debacle is  The Best Democracy Money Can Buy .  Honestly, I didn't even think it was controversial to say he stole it, but the front page of today's Independent says that 54 per cent of Americans believe he was legitimately elected.  What's your impression in the belly of the beast?  Also, can anyone point me to the investigative commission that concluded it was stolen?   urlLink Greg Palast  told me about it, but we were interrupted as he was telling me where to find it and I haven't had much luck searching online.

"1989",1989,589736,"Aries","           'The space program is bullshit.' - Don't hold back, tell us how you really feel!  ;)  Seriously though, is it the whole space program or just this latest decision/pronouncement you don't like?  We have and continue to enjoy the after effects of the initial Apollo missions with the spin off technologies.  I don't see that we will have the same boost as we got in the 60's from this, but that is the great thing about technology - you don't know about something useful until someone invents it.  '...the fact that over 9 million Americans (including myself) are unemployed...' - What exactly makes someone unemployed?  Is my wife unemployed?  She has no paying job but also does not want one right now.  Is she included in those statistics?  What about the artist/actor who does not have a job because they are busy trying to get a part or find a patron?  They could at least respond to any of the fast food restaurants that always have 'Now Hiring' signs out front.  Are they included?  9 out of roughly 250 is 4%, which I think is lower than the rates I had heard (~6%), so it makes my wonder even more as to exactly how they come up with the numbers.  It just proves the saying that there are three types of information - lies, damn lies, and statistics.  Note that I am not saying that we don't have too much unemployment.  I would love for there to be 0%, but short of the government hiring anyone without a job to do something, I don't think the government has the responsibility or even power to do anything about it.  '...our economy has continuously gone downhill ...' - The economic downturn/recession/depression/dip/or whatever the hell you want to call it began noticeably in March of 2000 when the stock market went through its 'correction' (I hate that term, but that's what they call it).  The NASDAQ went from 5000 to 2000 in something like 6 weeks and the NYSE had a similar drop, taking down many peoples retirement and college education savings with it.  A friend of mine stupidly was holding the money he had made from the sale of his house in NASDAQ and watched it get reduced to about 1/4 of the original amount.  Let's see, I believe that in March of 2000, Governor Bush was trying to secure the Republican nomination for the White House.  And let's see, yeah I can see where President Bush was directly responsible for allowing the terrorist attacks that lead to the deaths of ~3,300 people, shaking our country to it's core, and causing an already weak economy to weaken further.  But the really bad news for the argument is that the economy has grown for the last two quarters and the highest rates in 20 years.  '...Bush stole the presidency...' - Sigh.  Miriam, help me out here.  How many times have I addressed this one in the last 3 years?  20?  I know that Eva was not here for them, so I will state my response again.  There are laws in place in every state that govern the way public elections are to be held.  They were followed in Florida, but Al Gore wanted to change them so that the ballots would be counted again (making three times if I remember correctly).  Bush appealed to the State Supreme Court, which upheld the decision to go ahead and recount.  Bush then appealed to the US Supreme Court, who finally voted 5-4 to stop the recounts and declare a winner based on the votes counted.  The Democrats cried foul and this was partisan politics.  If it had truly been partisan, the vote would have been 7-2, as that is the breakdown of R vs. D appointees.  What that showed to me was that the court was deeply divided, but made a ruling and it was carried out without the violence that probably would have occurred in other countries.  The Democrats keep bringing up the 500,000 more votes that Gore received.  If our system of elections was based on straight count, then that would be a valid point.  But, since the US Constitution clearly spells out the Electoral College process, it does not matter.  What the Democrats should be doing is trying to shore up support in the states where they were close, transferring the popular vote to electoral votes and possibly a White House win (shudder).  As a side note, one or two of the Florida newspapers went back after the fact and counted the ballots.  There was a slight change in the numbers, but Bush still won the state by some ridiculously close margin (around 200 votes).  '...(1)poorly thought out, and (2)expensive, (3)publicity stunt.' - (1) I don't think it is poorly thought out.  All that he has done is to set a target.  Was Kennedy's proclamation poorly thought out in 1961?  (2) Yes it will be  (3)  Probably so.  But then again, anytime a President announces something, it can probably be considered a publicity stunt or at the very least politically motivated (see the recent immigration announcement)  'He's just cutting funding and jobs from other NASA programs. '  - Would you rather he keep funding them and come up with the money from, say, Medicare?  Will any of those people, say working on the Space Shuttle, be able to transfer to the new programs?  I would hope so.  I found out with some dismay this weekend that Sean O'Keefe (NASA administrator) announced that the next HST maintenance mission has been scrubbed.  The current gyros have a 50% chance of failing in the next year and 75% within the next two years.  Once they go, Hubble will not be usable.  Additionally, the mission was going to boost it into a higher orbit.  Without this, it sounds like Hubble will reenter the atmosphere sometime in the next 2-4 years.  The replacement telescope is not scheduled to be launched until 2008-2011.   Congratulations on the upcoming wedding.         "

I'm not asking what an anti-Bush website thinks about it, I'm asking what my fellow bloggers think about it.  In response to the website, for us, the USA, to think that space will remain unmilitarized forever is naive.  Especially since out good buddies in the Peoples Republic of China are rapidly developing their own space program, and I believe have announced plans for a moon mission (though my memory is vague on that).  They see us as a threat, rightly or wrongly, and we must be prepared.  Someone told me that space exploration is alot like having kids; if you wait until you are ready, it will never happen.  I can see his point.  We, the human species, have been trying to solve some of these pressing social problems (poverty, injustice) for about 3000 years now.  Sometimes with good effects (Roman and Greek rule was pretty good) and sometimes with bad (medieval Europe).  If we wait until the social problems are solved, then I don't think we will ever do it.         "
"1994",1994,589736,"Aries","           MISSION TO MARS FOR MILITARY BENEFIT, NOT JUST 'SPIRIT OF DISCOVERY'  President Bush unveiled his proposal for a new space program Wednesday by invoking the spirit of explorers Lewis and Clark, saying, 'They made that journey in the spirit of discovery... America has ventured forth into space for the same reasons.'   But the president didn't mention that members of his administration view space as the next frontier for military buildup and conquest.  Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld chaired the Commission to Assess United States National Security Space Management and Organization four years ago, releasing its findings in January 2001. Rumsfeld's report found that 'we know from history that every medium -- air, land and sea -- has seen conflict. Reality indicates that space will be no different.'  The panel also concluded that 'given this virtual certainty, the [United States] must develop the means both to deter and to defend against hostile acts in and from space.'  The president's focus on space exploration because it 'improves our lives, and lifts our national spirit.' However, behind the scenes, USA Today reported that Bush was persuaded to move forward in part due to the military benefits, as promoted to him by Vice President Cheney.   The Center for American Progress' Progress Report yesterday noted an appearance by Republican Congressman Tom Feeney on Scarborough Country where he stated, 'Somebody is going to dominate space.  When they do, just like when the British dominated the naval part of our globe, established their empire, just like the United States has dominated the air superiority, ultimately, whoever is able to dominate space will be able to control the destiny of the entire Earth.'  Feeney's comments echo PNAC's September 2000 report Rebuilding America's Defenses, which said, 'Much as control of the high seas - and the protection of international commerce defined global power in the past, so will control of the new 'international commons' be a key to world power in the future.'    urlLink -Bush Aims for Mars to Dominate Space Militarily          "

I am having fun watch the Democrats tear at each other in Iowa.  Now that Dean has abandoned his no attacking policy, I wonder how long it will be before Edwards does as well.  I am also curious as to why Wes Clark is spending so much money on TV ads in Virginia at this early juncture.  While it is a very good introctory ad, I have seen it enough times now to have a couple of questions about its veracity.  I am not saying that he has lied or even stretched the truth, but I don't think he has put forth the whole truth.  I really doubt that he had much to do with the actually negotiating the peace in Serbia.  He probably had a roll, but we have diplomats to handle these things and soldiers to enforce them.  Also, he comments that this was done without the loss of American lives.  The biggest difference is that we went in to an area where they hate each other (Serbs/Croats) more than they hate us.  In Iraq, the insurgents hate us, not the Shiites/Sunnis.  Yet again, I still have not heard a proposed answer to the situation (other than Dean's saying we need to pull out totally, now).

But, the more I think about, the more I question it.  Don't get me wrong, I still am in favor of it, but I'm not sure that we will see the benefits of the initial establishment of the NASA with all the new technology, which is what everyone in NASA seems to be touting as a reason to do this.  Computers are already improving at a rate that puts them ahead of the software designed to tax them.  We are constantly developing new and better materials (plastics, polymers, ceramics) and other electronics.  I don't see where the demands of this new mission are going to have much trickle down into daily society.  Sure, there will be localized job benefits to the areas that get work on certain aspects of the project, but unless we get our kids back where they should be in math and science, those jobs will go non-Americans.

"1999",1999,589736,"Aries","           Warning - The following post is given a grade of F for political correctness because it is anti-tax, and somewhat pro-smoker.  I have been listening to the governor talk about the need to overhaul our state tax system.  The one that troubles me most is the increase to the cigarette tax.  I have heard that Virginia has one of the lowest, if not the lowest, tax per pack.  That seems to be the overwhelming reason given to raise it.  If the revenue generated from this increase was to go directly to treating the illnesses of smokers with no reduction in the current amounts going there (i.e. an increase in actual spending), I would not have a problem with it.  But, I have observed politicians long enough to know that this will not be the case.  I point to the Virginia Lottery as my case in point.  When we (the voters) were sold on the concept of a lottery, we were told that all the profits would go to education.  The good news is that the politicians held true to their word for once.  The bad news is that the amount of money that had been coming from the general fund has dropped dramatically.  Basically, they used the lottery to fund something that everyone agrees needs it, in order to be able to increase some other programs.  I do not doubt that our current politicians would do the same thing with a cigarette tax.  Now, if they are just trying to raise more general revenue, this is also not a good idea.  I point to New York City as an example for this one.  They recently, within the last 2 years, raised the per pack tax to some astronomical level, like $5 a pack.  This was intended to help ease their budget problems.  Instead, they ended up with a larger deficit than before because all this revenue failed to appear.  The reason?  Smokers, despite there lack of heeding the warnings of the danger, aren't stupid.  They know that they can go someplace else to get their cigarettes and have done so.  Heck, I'm sure that some entrepreneurs did the math and realized that they could make several trips to Virginia, load up on lots of cartons, and took them back to New York where they sold them for a hefty markup but still less than the 'legal' packs.  The bottom line, to me anyway, is that getting whatever amount we get now is better than gambling that we won't lose more by raising the rates.  I know that Julie's parents get many cartons to take back to Florida whenever they pass through because of the price difference.  They aren't the only ones.  If you raise the rate, much of this business will dry up.         "

I guess he is trying to expand beyond 'That 70s Show' and 'Dude, Where's My Car?'  Ben - Good article.  I did notread 100% of it (got a Cliff Notes version?) , but it reinforced my apprehension about Wal-Mart.  What I did not see it mention was what Wal-Mart has done to the smaller niche businesses.  You know, the ones like a bike shop or small fabric store or even an independent drug store (as versus CVS or Wal-Greens).  Do you recall the huge fight that Ashland put up against the Wal-Mart opening there?  It was very big news when they one, but the victory was only temporary.  The Wal-Mart is now open.  I have not heard how it has affected the small businesses in Ashland.  On the flip side, I am hypocritical for criticizing them.  With one salary and 5 mouths to feed, Julie does 80+% of our shopping at Wal-Mart, in part because of price and because of the convenence of going to one store and getting everything we need.  A recent trip included soap, diapers, an oil filter, and a gallon of milk.  There's not too many stores that have all four of those items           "

And since that particular culture tends to be heavily Catholic....but we aren't going the religion route.  Comfort - If you are raised to believe that *all* dogs are mean killers.  You live 50 years of your life thinking that every dog you ever see is mean, and wants to kill you (versus nice and wants to kill you ;-p ).  Then, it is going to be very hard to accept a dog in your life when you turn 51.  Same with gay marriage.

"2043",2043,589736,"Aries","           I agree that it isn't ideology.  I was just tossing that out as a random statement.  As to the press conference, it is the press asking the questions, not either of the two leading candidates.  It is one of the roles of the press to reveal that those in power have feet of clay.  That said, it is also one of the roles of a police force to protect its citizens.  Some police officers reach beyond the originally-intended boundaries, pursuing that end proactively rather than reactively, through violence, profiling, or similiar strategies.  Such acts do not represent a flaw in the role; only in its interpretation and execution.  Likewise, the press occasionally (some would argue frequently) reaches beyond the originally-intended boundaries, in the interpretation and execution of its role.  In both cases, the flaw lies in an unrelated entity that has grafted itself onto, or even assimilated itself into, the original whole:  for the former, that foreign presence might be racism or ideology; for the latter, I would argue that the unwelcome intruder is advertising revenue, of which there is a finite amount, and which is determined by a publisher's ability to make the audience feel equally happy, sad, and superior.  This is not to say that the press is absolved of responsibility; I only add it as a probable explanation.  I don't think that in this situation the press is revealing a flaw in its calling, which I fully support.  Nor do I think that the press is revealing any particular ideological preference.  I think it smells a potentional story, and in its eagerness to get that story placed between lucrative advertising spots that require the largest possible audience, it displays not so much a mindless hunger, but rather an embarassing clumsiness in how it goes about its business.  Case in point:  It displays neither skill nor intelligence to grill someone at a press conference.  This isn't sharp and cunning journalism; it's grandstanding at best, simple rudeness at worst.  Take the potential lead and go snooping around the back doors.  Set out the honey and wait for the flies.  Watching the press conference live on cable yesterday, I was struck only by the mutual train wreck:  journalists behaving like a pack of dogs, and a poor government functionary who made a wrong choice a long time ago and now believes in the empty role he performs.  I still long for clever heroes and cunning villains who deserve respectful cheers and boos.  I am no longer interested in thugs and bullies, no matter what color hat they may wear.         "
"2044",2044,589736,"Aries","           This is not ideology.  This is the Democratic Party trying to find something that will stick when attacking Bush.

The last time I saw such vitriolic hatred (and I think Johnathan, as a neutral observer would agree) of a political figure was the late '90s with the Republicans hating Clinton.  I've got to tell you, it does not do much good.  It doesn't even make you feel good in the long run.  That does not make me ask the question of Ben and Mir (and any other Bush haters), what is it that makes you hate him personally?  And now as I type this, I just heard on Rush of a potential bombshell against Kerry that is being reported on the Drudge report.  Something about recent infidelity.  I have no other information, but, even if it is true, so what?  As long as he did not lie about in the course of federal/state/local investigation, it is between him and his wife.  I saw Edwards on the today show, and even though he did not let the ANG issue totally die, he did say that this election needs to be about much more than attendance records.  Hallelujah!

Joe Conason's Journal On Sunday, NBC's Tim Russert is scheduled to interview the president. Here are five questions he'll definitely want to ask.  Editor's note: This will be the last daily installment of Joe Conason's Journal. Beginning next week, look for less frequent but more in-depth investigative reports and commentary -- on the Bush administration and other political topics -- from Conason, every week in Salon.  Feb. 5, 2004  |  Tim Russert, dream interviewer  NBC's Tim Russert cherishes a reputation as network television's bulldog interrogator of wayward politicians. His image is good cop/bad cop in the same guy. This coming Sunday, the president will reportedly appear on 'Meet the Press.' That decision may well reflect, as Nick Confessore suggested today, Karl Rove's confidence that Russert isn't really so goddamned tough, especially not on Republicans. If so, Rove would be in rare agreement with many of Russert's critics on the left.   Knowing Russert, I think he would hate to confirm such nasty suspicions when he interviews George W. Bush (although he would also hasten to plead that some partisans on both sides are never satisfied, etc.). Let's help him with a few questions (and follow-ups) that nobody could call softballs:      1. Given the controversy about your attendance record during your National Guard service, Mr. President, perhaps the best way to resolve matters would be to authorize the release of all of your military records, including pay stubs, Social Security records and so-called retirement-points records. Will you do that? If not, why not, and how can the American people believe that you actually fulfilled your service obligations as everyone else in the Guard was required to do?   2. Mr. President, on page 54 of your autobiography, 'A Charge to Keep,' you wrote: 'I continued flying with my unit for the next several years.' But the truth is that you quit flying after less than two years, despite fighter training that cost the taxpayers almost a million dollars. Did your superiors approve your decision to quit flying, or did you just quit on your own? Weren't you suspended from flying in August 1972 after you failed to take a required physical exam? Why didn't you take that physical?     3. Mr. President, I'd like to ask you about the now-famous 'mission accomplished' speech you gave on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln outside San Diego last May. You landed on the carrier in a flight suit -- a piece of videotape shown around the world. [Roll tape.] A lot of your critics were appalled by that image. Here's a man who never fought in a war, never saw the danger and horrors of real combat, dressing up like a soldier and proclaiming a victory that, as it turned out, we were far from accomplishing. As you look back on it, has it ever occurred to you, that Eisenhower, who won D-day, never dressed in uniform when he was president; John F. Kennedy, who was a genuine war hero, never dressed in uniform either. Was there something disrespectful to the military in a costume stunt like that? Your thoughts, sir.   4. You have blamed the rapidly rising, unsustainable federal deficits on 'out-of-control' domestic spending. But Mr. President, the plain fact, according to every nonpartisan analyst, is that your tax cuts are responsible for a far greater percentage of present and future deficits than spending. Your current budget proposal cuts billions in programs for children and veterans. Wouldn't it be more compassionate -- and more responsible -- to rescind some of the tax breaks for the very wealthiest Americans?   5. Sir, with respect, most economists say that the tax cuts are responsible for no more than 20 percent of the recent economic growth, and that the recession could have been addressed with a short-term stimulus primarily aimed at middle- and working-class tax payers, rather than long-term tax cuts tilted toward the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers. These long-term tax cuts for the wealthy are the major cause for these massive structural deficits that we now have and the complete inability to fund some of these programs for children, the elderly and veterans. How does that reflect responsible Republicanism or compassionate conservatism?   You may say that I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one.             "

I use safe in quotes because nothing about the birthing process is without danger.  As much as doctors know, they still don't understand all the vagaries of child birth.

According to the Federal Times, the president's appointee at the Office of Special Counsel ruled that federal employees will now 'have no recourse if they are fired or demoted simply for being gay.' (2)   While the Bush Administration says it is legally prohibited from firing a person for their conduct, they have the legal right to fire or demote someone based on their sexual orientation. To carry out the directive, the White House has begun removing information from government websites about sexual orientation discrimination in the workplace. (3)  Not only does the new directive contradict the president's own promise to treat homosexuals as equals under the law, but it also contradicts what the Administration told Congress.

"2126",2126,589736,"Aries","           My take on the whole 'saving people' thing, speaking as a Christian, is that I feel as though the best way to convey my beliefs to others is to live as an example of them.   To me, the true message of Christ was one of inclusivity, understanding, compassion, forgiveness, and above all, love.  And being a Christian to me means living a life that is 'Christ-like.'  Though I know that I am by no means without sin, the most important thing for me is to live my life with love and compassion to the best of my human ability.  As for the film...  I have yet to see it.  I think I'd prefer to see it privately in my own home, because my faith is very strong and very personal to me.  I feel like I might leave the film feeling like an open wound, and I don't want to risk being around insensitivity at a moment like that...  But as for the way it is marketed...  The movie business is still just that...a business.  It is an unfortunate reality that, if you want to put asses in seats, you have to have some sort of draw.  Since James Caviezel is not yet an A-List celebrity (though I think he could be...he's a brilliant actor), his name alone is not enough.  And while many people love Mel Gibson, the masses of asses in seats tend to prefer a Mel that is in front of the camera, not behind it.  So producers, wanting to make money on a film that they know is monetarily risky, come up with a way to sell the film, i.e., 'the TRUE story of WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.'  Whether or not it is historically accurate does not matter to me.  As Harmonium touched upon, truth and fact are not synonymous.  After the release of 'The Killing Fields,' director Roland Joffe asked one of the journalists, on whose experiences the film was based, if the film was accurate.  He replied with a yes and no.  No, he said, that's not exactly what really happened.  But yes, he said, that's exactly what it  felt  like.            "

"2130",2130,589736,"Aries","           On a side note about 'faith'...  This past weekend, two ladies came to my door.  After greetings were passed, one promptly asked me, and I paraphrase, 'Do you think you are going to Heaven when you die?'.  My response was a prompt but polite 'No.'.  They appeared shocked and asked me why.  I said that you can't go someplace that doesn't exist.  I explained that I am an atheist, and I believe that 'there is no god, or satan, or heaven, hell'.  And their response was, 'but you have to have faith in that, right?'  She went on to say that when you sit in a chair, do you thoroughly inspect it first, or do you just go and sit down?  Meaning that you have to have faith that the chair will support you, and won't fall apart.  My question is this....Since when did religion trademark the word 'faith' as only pertaining to ones belief in a deity of some sort.  Why is it that if I have faith, then I must in some way or another believe in god?  No offense to the christians out there, but it really pissed me off.         "
"2131",2131,589736,"Aries","           ...and that's what bugged me enough to post; that the film maker went out of his way to make the film 'historically accurate', but then dropped the ball on the color issue.  regardless of one's opinion on Jesus' ethnicity (or at least, that of people living in the Middle East during the time period he supposedly lived in), the actors could have at least been a  little  darker skinned - they all lived in a desert, for pete's sake!  you could have had a chinese guy playing christ in a snowstorm, as long as you didn't expect me to look at your film as a depiction of how the people and places 'really looked', which is what gibson's film purports to do (and succeeded in doing in many other ways, apparently).  but is that really the point when you're telling 'the greatest story ever told'?  shouldn't even a pretty good story be able stand on its own, in regards to its message(s)?  shakespeare's plays can be set in any time period, and they work fine; no one balks at the inevitable 'anachronisms', because his were universal stories from the get-go.  i wish more christians would do the same, by acknowledging the power of allegory to promote faith and belief, rather than insisting that the events in their stories have to have 'really happened' to be significant.    it doesn't matter if jesus ever really existed, anymore than odysseus or buddha or any number of characters in the great stories of our species; what matters is the message, not the messenger (or the creed).  what we learn about  ourselves  in reading about these folk is what matters.  in another thousand years, all of them will have been modified tenfold to suit the cultures and opinions of times to come, just as they have been many times before.  hopefully, the essence of the stories will persist and prevail - and not because we ever felt the need to prove that they 'really happened', which is all but impossible, and in my opinion, needless.          "
"2132",2132,589736,"Aries","           For myself, the historicity of a representation of a figure such as Jesus or the Buddha is completely irrelevant.  What matters to me are the words and the act(s).  My own research has revealed that Gibson intended to film an interpretation, albeit one that is more 'gritty' and 'violent.'  In that sense -- and in that sense only -- it seems that the film can be tested against realism.  In terms of event and image, it is, like all films, a personal visual exploration.  As Ebert often says, a movie is not about what it is about, but how it is about it.  As a sidenote, there is a curious need in modern society to equate 'veracity' with 'truth,' as if they have anything at all to do with each other.  At least once a year, a newsmagazine devotes a cover story to the 'real Jesus,' the 'real Muhammed,' the 'real Whoever' -- as if evidence matters in the search for truth.  Evidence yields nothing but data.  Data has its uses, and for many from the 18th century Enlightenment onward, its presence can evoke deep satisfaction -- but in the great cocktail party of the universe, beyond nodding to each other at the cheese table, data and faith have very little to talk about.         "
"2133",2133,589736,"Aries","           I'm mixed on this aspect of the film.  While it is Mel Gibson's right to create a film with his own artistic vision, it then comes down to whether the film is being done with a heavy influence of historical accuracy OR simply being made from ones own interpretation of an event.  This picture seems to be made as the latter.  And like Harmonium said, I don't have a problem with that.  But you can't also try and market that same product as being historically accurate, when it just isn't.....if indeed that is what is being done.         "

The Cobb County schools' disclaimer, in the form of a sticker on the inside front cover of textbooks, could have the effect of advancing or inhibiting religion, U.S. District Judge Clarence Cooper ruled in ordering the suit to go to trial.     'We're very excited about this,' said attorney Michael Manely, who represents the six Cobb County parents who sued the system in August 2002.   The lawsuit argues that the disclaimer restricts the teaching of evolution, promotes and requires the teaching of creationism and discriminates against particular religions.         The sticker reads: 'This textbook contains material on evolution. Evolution is a theory, not a fact, regarding the origin of living things. This material should be approached with an open mind, studied carefully and critically considered.'   The judge weighed the constitutionality of the issue by applying a three-pronged test handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1971. In order to get the lawsuit dismissed, the school board had to show that the disclaimer was adopted with a secular purpose; that its primary effect neither advances nor inhibits religion; and that it does not result in an excessive entanglement of government with religion.   In his order signed last Wednesday, Cooper said the school board satisfied him on the first issue.   But he noted that while the disclaimer has no biblical reference, it encourages students to consider alternatives other than evolution. The judge found that the disclaimer could have the effect of advancing or inhibiting religion.   'Indeed, most of the board members concurred that they wanted students to consider other alternatives,' Cooper wrote.   The theory of evolution, accepted by most scientists, says evidence shows current species of life evolved over time from earlier forms and that natural selection determines which species survive. Creationism credits the origin of species to God.   In 1987, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled creationism was a religious belief that could not be taught in public schools along with evolution.             "

If every single vote cast for Nader had been cast for Gore, which is of course extremely arrogant supposition, then yes, Al Gore would be the president of the United States (shudder),  But, it would not have turned into the landslide that Ms. Randi seems to think it would.  Here's a big surprise (tic).  The areas with the most Nader support were areas that Gore won handily.  The only states in which there would have been a different outcome are Florida and New Hampshire.  The revised total would have been 295-242, the closest since Carter-Ford in 1976 (297-240).  That's a far cry from Nixon-McGovern in 1972 (520-17), Reagan-Carter (489-49), Reagan-Mondale (525-13), Bush-Dukakis (426-111), Clinton-Bush (370-168), or Clinton-Dole in 1996 (379-159).  Some interesting tidbits in reviewing the results- Some states do not allow write in candidtates for president (HI, LA, NE, NV, NM, OK, SC, SD) 3,315 people in Nevada cast a vote for 'None of these candidates' 1 Electoral College member from DC abstained instead of casting his vote for Gore as tradition calls for.

'Films like 'The Chronicles of Riddick' gather about them cadres of fans who obsess about every smallest detail, but somehow I don't think 'Riddick' will make as many converts as 'The Matrix.' In fact, I owe an apology to fans of the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy.    When Richard Roeper reviewed the current two-disc DVD of 'Lord of the Rings: Return of the King' on TV, I noted that a four-disc set of the movie was coming out later this year. He observed that the complete trilogy will come out on 'an accordion size set that will take up the next six years of your life.' I observed that 'LOTR' fans should 'get a life.' I meant this as an affectionate ironic throwaway, but have received dozens of wounded e-mails from Ring devotees who believe 'LOTR' has, indeed, given them a life, and after seeing 'The Chronicles of Riddick,' I agree. They have a life. The prospect of become an expert on 'Riddick,' in contrast, is too depressing to contemplate.'         "

Gave Advice in 2002  By Dana Priest and R. Jeffrey Smith Washington Post Staff Writers Tuesday, June 8, 2004; Page A01    In August 2002, the Justice Department advised the White House that torturing al Qaeda terrorists in captivity abroad 'may be justified,' and that international laws against torture 'may be unconstitutional if applied to interrogations' conducted in President Bush's war on terrorism, according to a newly obtained memo.          If a government employee were to torture a suspect in captivity, 'he would be doing so in order to prevent further attacks on the United States by the Al Qaeda terrorist network,' said the memo, from the Justice Department's office of legal counsel, written in response to a CIA request for legal guidance. It added that arguments centering on 'necessity and self-defense could provide justifications that would eliminate any criminal liability' later.   The memo seems to counter the pre-Sept. 11, 2001, assumption that U.S. government personnel would never be permitted to torture captives. It was offered after the CIA began detaining and interrogating suspected al Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the wake of the attacks, according to government officials familiar with the document.   The legal reasoning in the 2002 memo, which covered treatment of al Qaeda detainees in CIA custody, was later used in a March 2003 report by Pentagon lawyers assessing interrogation rules governing the Defense Department's detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. At that time, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld had asked the lawyers to examine the logistical, policy and legal issues associated with interrogation techniques.   Bush administration officials say flatly that, despite the discussion of legal issues in the two memos, it has abided by international conventions barring torture, and that detainees at Guantanamo and elsewhere have been treated humanely, except in the cases of abuse at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq for which seven military police soldiers have been charged.   Still, the 2002 and 2003 memos reflect the Bush administration's desire to explore the limits on how far it could legally go in aggressively interrogating foreigners suspected of terrorism or of having information that could thwart future attacks.   In the 2002 memo, written for the CIA and addressed to White House Counsel Alberto R. Gonzales, the Justice Department defined torture in a much narrower way, for example, than does the U.S. Army, which has historically carried out most wartime interrogations.   In the Justice Department's view -- contained in a 50-page document signed by Assistant Attorney General Jay S. Bybee and obtained by The Washington Post -- inflicting moderate or fleeting pain does not necessarily constitute torture. Torture, the memo says, 'must be equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or even death.'   By contrast, the Army's Field Manual 34-52, titled 'Intelligence Interrogations,' sets more restrictive rules. For example, the Army prohibits pain induced by chemicals or bondage; forcing an individual to stand, sit or kneel in abnormal positions for prolonged periods of time; and food deprivation. Under mental torture, the Army prohibits mock executions, sleep deprivation and chemically induced psychosis.   Human rights groups expressed dismay at the Justice Department's legal reasoning yesterday.   'It is by leaps and bounds the worst thing I've seen since this whole Abu Ghraib scandal broke,' said Tom Malinowski of Human Rights Watch. 'It appears that what they were contemplating was the commission of war crimes and looking for ways to avoid legal accountability. The effect is to throw out years of military doctrine and standards on interrogations.'   But a spokesman for the White House counsel's office said, 'The president directed the military to treat al Qaeda and Taliban humanely and consistent with the Geneva Conventions.'            "

We are here tonight because we love our country.   We are proud of what America is and what it can become.   My fellow Americans: we are here tonight united in one simple purpose: to make America stronger at home and respected in the world.  A great American novelist wrote that you can't go home again.  He could not have imagined this evening.  Tonight, I am home. Home where my public life began and those who made it possible live.  Home where our nation's history was written in blood, idealism, and hope.  Home where my parents showed me the values of family, faith, and country.  Thank you, all of you, for a welcome home I will never forget.   I wish my parents could share this moment.  They went to their rest in the last few years, but their example, their inspiration, their gift of open eyes, open mind, and endless world are bigger and more lasting than any words.  I was born in Colorado, in Fitzsimmons Army Hospital, when my dad was a pilot in World War II.  Now, I'm not one to read into things, but guess which wing of the hospital the maternity ward was in?  I'm not making this up.  I was born in the West Wing!  My mother was the rock of our family as so many mothers are. She stayed up late to help me do my homework. She sat by my bed when I was sick, and she answered the questions of a child who, like all children, found the world full of wonders and mysteries.  She was my den mother when I was a Cub Scout and she was so proud of her fifty year pin as a Girl Scout leader. She gave me her passion for the environment.  She taught me to see trees as the cathedrals of nature. And by the power of her example, she showed me that we can and must finish the march toward full equality for all women in our country.   My dad did the things that a boy remembers.  He gave me my first model airplane, my first baseball mitt and my first bicycle.  He also taught me that we are here for something bigger than ourselves; he lived out the responsibilities and sacrifices of the greatest generation to whom we owe so much.    When I was a young man, he was in the State Department, stationed in Berlin when it and the world were divided between democracy and communism. I have unforgettable memories of being a kid mesmerized by the British, French, and American troops, each of them guarding their own part of the city, and Russians standing guard on the stark line separating East from West. On one occasion, I rode my bike into Soviet East Berlin. And when I proudly told my dad, he promptly grounded me.   But what I learned has stayed with me for a lifetime. I saw how different life was on different sides of the same city. I saw the fear in the eyes of people who were not free.  I saw the gratitude of people toward the United States for all that we had done. I felt goose bumps as I got off a military train and heard the Army band strike up 'Stars and Stripes Forever.'  I learned what it meant to be America at our best. I learned the pride of our freedom.  And I am determined now to restore that pride to all who look to America.   Mine were greatest generation parents. And as I thank them, we all join together to thank that whole generation for making America strong, for winning World War II, winning the Cold War, and for the great gift of service which brought America fifty years of peace and prosperity.     My parents inspired me to serve, and when I was a junior in high school, John Kennedy called my generation to service.  It was the beginning of a great journey  a time to march for civil rights, for voting rights, for the environment, for women, and for peace. We believed we could change the world. And you know what? We did.   But we're not finished. The journey isn't complete.  The march isn't over.  The promise isn't perfected.   Tonight, we're setting out again.  And together, we're going to write the next great chapter of America's story.   We have it in our power to change the world again.  But only if we're true to our ideals  and that starts by telling the truth to the American people. That is my first pledge to you tonight.  As President, I will restore trust and credibility to the White House.  I ask you to judge me by my record:  As a young prosecutor, I fought for victim's rights and made prosecuting violence against women a priority.  When I came to the Senate, I broke with many in my own party to vote for a balanced budget, because I thought it was the right thing to do.  I fought to put a 100,000 cops on the street.  And then I reached across the aisle to work with John McCain, to find the truth about our POW's and missing in action, and to finally make peace with Vietnam.     I will be a commander in chief who will never mislead us into war.  I will have a Vice President who will not conduct secret meetings with polluters to rewrite our environmental laws.  I will have a Secretary of Defense who will listen to the best advice of our military leaders.   And I will appoint an Attorney General who actually upholds the Constitution of the United States.   My fellow Americans, this is the most important election of our lifetime. The stakes are high. We are a nation at war  a global war on terror against an enemy unlike any we have ever known before. And here at home, wages are falling, health care costs are rising, and our great middle class is shrinking. People are working weekends; they're working two jobs, three jobs, and they're still not getting ahead.   We're told that outsourcing jobs is good for America. We're told that new jobs that pay $9,000 less than the jobs that have been lost is the best we can do.  They say this is the best economy we've ever had.  And they say that anyone who thinks otherwise is a pessimist.  Well, here is our answer:  There is nothing more pessimistic than saying America can't do better.   We can do better and we will.  We're the optimists. For us, this is a country of the future. We're the can do people.  And let's not forget what we did in the 1990s. We balanced the budget. We paid down the debt.  We created 23 million new jobs. We lifted millions out of poverty and we lifted the standard of living for the middle class. We just need to believe in ourselves  and we can do it again.   So tonight, in the city where America's freedom began, only a few blocks from where the sons and daughters of liberty gave birth to our nation  here tonight, on behalf of a new birth of freedom  on behalf of the middle class who deserve a champion, and those struggling to join it who deserve a fair shot  for the brave men and women in uniform who risk their lives every day and the families who pray for their return  for all those who believe our best days are ahead of us  for all of you  with great faith in the American people, I accept your nomination for President of the United States.   I am proud that at my side will be a running mate whose life is the story of the American dream and who's worked every day to make that dream real for all Americans  Senator John Edwards of North Carolina. And his wonderful wife Elizabeth and their family. This son of a mill worker is ready to lead  and next January, Americans will be proud to have a fighter for the middle class to succeed Dick Cheney as Vice President of the United States.   And what can I say about Teresa?  She has the strongest moral compass of anyone I know. She's down to earth, nurturing, courageous, wise and smart.  She speaks her mind and she speaks the truth, and I love her for that, too. And that's why America will embrace her as the next First Lady of the United States.   For Teresa and me, no matter what the future holds or the past has given us, nothing will ever mean as much as our children. We love them not just for who they are and what they've become, but for being themselves, making us laugh, holding our feet to the fire, and never letting me get away with anything.  Thank you, Andre, Alex, Chris, Vanessa, and John.  And in this journey, I am accompanied by an extraordinary band of brothers led by that American hero, a patriot named Max Cleland.  Our band of brothers doesn't march together because of who we are as veterans, but because of what we learned as soldiers. We fought for this nation because we loved it and we came back with the deep belief that every day is extra.  We may be a little older now, we may be a little grayer, but we still know how to fight for our country.   And standing with us in that fight are those who shared with me the long season of the primary campaign:  Carol Moseley Braun, General Wesley Clark, Howard Dean, Dick Gephardt, Bob Graham, Dennis Kucinich, Joe Lieberman and Al Sharpton.   To all of you, I say thank you for teaching me and testing me  but mostly, we say thank you for standing up for our country and giving us the unity to move America forward.   My fellow Americans, the world tonight is very different from the world of four years ago. But I believe the American people are more than equal to the challenge.   Remember the hours after September 11th, when we came together as one to answer the attack against our homeland. We drew strength when our firefighters ran up the stairs and risked their lives, so that others might live. When rescuers rushed into smoke and fire at the Pentagon.  When the men and women of Flight 93 sacrificed themselves to save our nation's Capitol. When flags were hanging from front porches all across America, and strangers became friends. It was the worst day we have ever seen, but it brought out the best in all of us.    I am proud that after September 11th all our people rallied to President Bush's call for unity to meet the danger. There were no Democrats.  There were no Republicans. There were only Americans.  How we wish it had stayed that way.   Now I know there are those who criticize me for seeing complexities  and I do  because some issues just aren't all that simple.  Saying there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq doesn't make it so.  Saying we can fight a war on the cheap doesnt make it so. And proclaiming mission accomplished certainly doesn't make it so.    As President, I will ask hard questions and demand hard evidence.  I will immediately reform the intelligence system  so policy is guided by facts, and facts are never distorted by politics.  And as President, I will bring back this nation's time-honored tradition: the United States of America never goes to war because we want to, we only go to war because we have to.  I know what kids go through when they are carrying an M-16 in a dangerous place and they can't tell friend from foe.  I know what they go through when they're out on patrol at night and they don't know what's coming around the next bend. I know what it's like to write letters home telling your family that everything's all right when you're not sure that's true.    As President, I will wage this war with the lessons I learned in war.  Before you go to battle, you have to be able to look a parent in the eye and truthfully say: 'I tried everything possible to avoid sending your son or daughter into harm's way. But we had no choice. We had to protect the American people, fundamental American values from a threat that was real and imminent.'  So lesson one, this is the only justification for going to war.   And on my first day in office, I will send a message to every man and woman in our armed forces: You will never be asked to fight a war without a plan to win the peace.  I know what we have to do in Iraq.  We need a President who has the credibility to bring our allies to our side and share the burden, reduce the cost to American taxpayers, and reduce the risk to American soldiers.  That's the right way to get the job done and bring our troops home.   Here is the reality: that won't happen until we have a president who restores America's respect and leadership -- so we don't have to go it alone in the world.    And we need to rebuild our alliances, so we can get the terrorists before they get us.    I defended this country as a young man and I will defend it as President.  Let there be no mistake:  I will never hesitate to use force when it is required.  Any attack will be met with a swift and certain response. I will never give any nation or international institution a veto over our national security.  And I will build a stronger American military.  We will add 40,000 active duty troops  not in Iraq, but to strengthen American forces that are now overstretched, overextended, and under pressure. We will double our special forces to conduct anti-terrorist operations. We will provide our troops with the newest weapons and technology to save their lives  and win the battle.  And we will end the backdoor draft of National Guard and reservists.  To all who serve in our armed forces today, I say, help is on the way.   As President, I will fight a smarter, more effective war on terror. We will deploy every tool in our arsenal: our economic as well as our military might; our principles as well as our firepower.    In these dangerous days there is a right way and a wrong way to be strong. Strength is more than tough words. After decades of experience in national security, I know the reach of our power and I know the power of our ideals.  We need to make America once again a beacon in the world. We need to be looked up to and not just feared.    We need to lead a global effort against nuclear proliferation  to keep the most dangerous weapons in the world out of the most dangerous hands in the world.     We need a strong military and we need to lead strong alliances.  And then, with confidence and determination, we will be able to tell the terrorists: You will lose and we will win.  The future doesn't belong to fear; it belongs to freedom.    And the front lines of this battle are not just far away  they're right here on our shores, at our airports, and potentially in any town or city. Today, our national security begins with homeland security. The 9-11 Commission has given us a path to follow, endorsed by Democrats, Republicans, and the 9-11 families.  As President, I will not evade or equivocate; I will immediately implement the recommendations of that commission.  We shouldn't be letting ninety-five percent of container ships come into our ports without ever being physically inspected.  We shouldn't be leaving our nuclear and chemical plants without enough protection.  And we shouldn't be opening firehouses in Baghdad and closing them down in the United States of America.   And tonight, we have an important message for those who question the patriotism of Americans who offer a better direction for our country.  Before wrapping themselves in the flag and shutting their eyes and ears to the truth, they should remember what America is really all about. They should remember the great idea of freedom for which so many have given their lives.  Our purpose now is to reclaim democracy itself. We are here to affirm that when Americans stand up and speak their minds and say America can do better, that is not a challenge to patriotism; it is the heart and soul of patriotism.   You see that flag up there.  We call her Old Glory. The stars and stripes forever. I fought under that flag, as did so many of you here and all across our country. That flag flew from the gun turret right behind my head. It was shot through and through and tattered, but it never ceased to wave in the wind. It draped the caskets of men I served with and friends I grew up with.  For us, that flag is the most powerful symbol of who we are and what we believe in. Our strength. Our diversity. Our love of country. All that makes America both great and good.   That flag doesn't belong to any president. It doesn't belong to any ideology and it doesn't belong to any political party. It belongs to all the American people.   My fellow citizens, elections are about choices. And choices are about values.  In the end, it's not just policies and programs that matter; the president who sits at that desk must be guided by principle.   For four years, we've heard a lot of talk about values. But values spoken without actions taken are just slogans.  Values are not just words.  They're what we live by. They're about the causes we champion and the people we fight for. And it is time for those who talk about family values to start valuing families.   You don't value families by kicking kids out of after school programs and taking cops off our streets, so that Enron can get another tax break.   We believe in the family value of caring for our children and protecting the neighborhoods where they walk and play.    And that is the choice in this election.   You don't value families by denying real prescription drug coverage to seniors, so big drug companies can get another windfall.    We believe in the family value expressed in one of the oldest Commandments: 'Honor thy father and thy mother.'  As President, I will not privatize Social Security. I will not cut benefits. And together, we will make sure that senior citizens never have to cut their pills in half because they can't afford life-saving medicine.     And that is the choice in this election.  You don't value families if you force them to take up a collection to buy body armor for a son or daughter in the service, if you deny veterans health care, or if you tell middle class families to wait for a tax cut, so that the wealthiest among us can get even more.  We believe in the value of doing what's right for everyone in the American family.   And that is the choice in this election.   We believe that what matters most is not narrow appeals masquerading as values, but the shared values that show the true face of America.  Not narrow appeals that divide us, but shared values that unite us.  Family and faith.  Hard work and responsibility. Opportunity for all  so that every child, every parent, every worker has an equal shot at living up to their God-given potential.  What does it mean in America today when Dave McCune, a steel worker I met in Canton, Ohio, saw his job sent overseas and the equipment in his factory literally unbolted, crated up, and shipped thousands of miles away along with that job?  What does it mean when workers I've met had to train their foreign replacements?    America can do better.  So tonight we say: help is on the way.  What does it mean when Mary Ann Knowles, a woman with breast cancer I met in New Hampshire, had to keep working day after day right through her chemotherapy, no matter how sick she felt, because she was terrified of losing her family's health insurance.   America can do better.  And help is on the way.  What does it mean when Deborah Kromins from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania works and saves all her life only to find out that her pension has disappeared into thin air  and the executive who looted it has bailed out on a golden parachute?   America can do better.  And help is on the way.  What does it mean when twenty five percent of the children in Harlem have asthma because of air pollution?   America can do better.  And help is on the way.  What does it mean when people are huddled in blankets in the cold, sleeping in Lafayette Park on the doorstep of the White House itself  and the number of families living in poverty has risen by three million in the last four years?    America can do better.  And help is on the way.  And so we come here tonight to ask: Where is the conscience of our country?   I'll tell you where it is: it's in rural and small town America; it's in urban neighborhoods and suburban main streets; it's alive in the people I've met in every part of this land. It's bursting in the hearts of Americans who are determined to give our country back its values and its truth.   We value jobs that pay you more not less than you earned before.  We value jobs where, when you put in a week's work, you can actually pay your bills, provide for your children, and lift up the quality of your life.  We value an America where the middle class is not being squeezed, but doing better.   So here is our economic plan to build a stronger America:    First, new incentives to revitalize manufacturing.    Second, investment in technology and innovation that will create the good-paying jobs of the future.    Third, close the tax loopholes that reward companies for shipping our jobs overseas.  Instead, we will reward companies that create and keep good paying jobs where they belong  in the good old U.S.A.    We value an America that exports products, not jobs  and we believe American workers should never have to subsidize the loss of their own job.   Next, we will trade and compete in the world.  But our plan calls for a fair playing field  because if you give the American worker a fair playing field, there's nobody in the world the American worker can't compete against.    And we're going to return to fiscal responsibility because it is the foundation of our economic strength.  Our plan will cut the deficit in half in four years by ending tax giveaways that are nothing more than corporate welfare  and will make government live by the rule that every family has to follow: pay as you go.    And let me tell you what we won't do: we won't raise taxes on the middle class. You've heard a lot of false charges about this in recent months. So let me say straight out what I will do as President: I will cut middle class taxes.  I will reduce the tax burden on small business. And I will roll back the tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals who make over $200,000 a year, so we can invest in job creation, health care and education.   Our education plan for a stronger America sets high standards and demands accountability from parents, teachers, and schools. It provides for smaller class sizes and treats teachers like the professionals they are. And it gives a tax credit to families for each and every year of college.  When I was a prosecutor, I met young kids who were in trouble, abandoned by adults.  And as President, I am determined that we stop being a nation content to spend $50,000 a year to keep a young person in prison for the rest of their life  when we could invest $10,000 to give them Head Start, Early Start, Smart Start, the best possible start in life.  And we value health care that's affordable and accessible for all Americans.  Since 2000, four million people have lost their health insurance. Millions more are struggling to afford it.   You know what's happening. Your premiums, your co-payments, your deductibles have all gone through the roof.  Our health care plan for a stronger America cracks down on the waste, greed, and abuse in our health care system and will save families up to $1,000 a year on their premiums.  You'll get to pick your own doctor  and patients and doctors, not insurance company bureaucrats, will make medical decisions.  Under our plan, Medicare will negotiate lower drug prices for seniors. And all Americans will be able to buy less expensive prescription drugs from countries like Canada.    The story of people struggling for health care is the story of so many Americans. But you know what, it's not the story of senators and members of Congress.  Because we give ourselves great health care and you get the bill. Well, I'm here to say, your family's health care is just as important as any politician's in Washington, D.C.  And when I'm President, America will stop being the only advanced nation in the world which fails to understand that health care is not a privilege for the wealthy, the connected, and the elected  it is a right for all Americans.   We value an America that controls its own destiny because it's finally and forever independent of Mideast oil.  What does it mean for our economy and our national security when we only have three percent of the world's oil reserves, yet we rely on foreign countries for fifty-three percent of what we consume?    I want an America that relies on its own ingenuity and innovation  not the Saudi royal family.   And our energy plan for a stronger America will invest in new technologies and alternative fuels and the cars of the future -- so that no young American in uniform will ever be held hostage to our dependence on oil from the Middle East.  I've told you about our plans for the economy, for education, for health care, for energy independence.  I want you to know more about them.  So now I'm going to say something that Franklin Roosevelt could never have said in his acceptance speech:  go to johnkerry.com.  I want to address these next words directly to President George W. Bush: In the weeks ahead, let's be optimists, not just opponents. Let's build unity in the American family, not angry division. Let's honor this nation's diversity; let's respect one another; and let's never misuse for political purposes the most precious document in American history, the Constitution of the United States.   My friends, the high road may be harder, but it leads to a better place. And that's why Republicans and Democrats must make this election a contest of big ideas, not small-minded attacks. This is our time to reject the kind of politics calculated to divide race from race, group from group, region from region. Maybe some just see us divided into red states and blue states, but I see us as one America  red, white, and blue. And when I am President, the government I lead will enlist people of talent, Republicans as well as Democrats, to find the common ground  so that no one who has something to contribute will be left on the sidelines.  And let me say it plainly: in that cause, and in this campaign, we welcome people of faith. America is not us and them. I think of what Ron Reagan said of his father a few weeks ago, and I want to say this to you tonight: I don't wear my own faith on my sleeve. But faith has given me values and hope to live by, from Vietnam to this day, from Sunday to Sunday. I don't want to claim that God is on our side. As Abraham Lincoln told us, I want to pray humbly that we are on God's side. And whatever our faith, one belief should bind us all: The measure of our character is our willingness to give of ourselves for others and for our country.  These aren't Democratic values. These aren't Republican values. They're American values.  We believe in them. They're who we are. And if we honor them, if we believe in ourselves, we can build an America that's stronger at home and respected in the world.   So much promise stretches before us. Americans have always reached for the impossible, looked to the next horizon, and asked: What if?   Two young bicycle mechanics from Dayton asked what if this airplane could take off at Kitty Hawk?  It did that and changed the world forever.  A young president asked what if we could go to the moon in ten years?  And now we're exploring the solar system and the stars themselves.  A young generation of entrepreneurs asked, what if we could take all the information in a library and put it on a little chip the size of a fingernail?  We did and that too changed the world forever.  And now it's our time to ask: What if?   What if we find a breakthrough to cure Parkinson's, diabetes, Alzheimer's and AIDs?  What if we have a president who believes in science, so we can unleash the wonders of discovery like stem cell research to treat illness and save millions of lives?   What if we do what adults should do  and make sure all our children are safe in the afternoons after school?  And what if we have a leadership that's as good as the American dream  so that bigotry and hatred never again steal the hope and future of any American?  I learned a lot about these values on that gunboat patrolling the Mekong Delta with young Americans who came from places as different as Iowa and Oregon, Arkansas, Florida and California.  No one cared where we went to school.  No one cared about our race or our backgrounds. We were literally all in the same boat. We looked out, one for the other  and we still do.   That is the kind of America I will lead as President  an America where we are all in the same boat.   Never has there been a more urgent moment for Americans to step up and define ourselves. I will work my heart out.  But, my fellow citizens, the outcome is in your hands more than mine.    It is time to reach for the next dream.  It is time to look to the next horizon.  For America, the hope is there.  The sun is rising.  Our best days are still to come.    Goodnight, God bless you, and God bless America.    urlLink johnkerry.com           "

"2246",2246,589736,"Aries","            &nbsp;EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE:    LAW ENFORCEMENT:I was arrested in Kennebunkport, Maine, in 1976 for driving under the influence of alcohol. I pled guilty, paid a fine, and had my driver's license suspended for 30 days. My Texas driving record has been 'lost' and is not available.   MILITARY:I joined the Texas Air National Guard and went AWOL. I refused to take a drug test or answer any questions about my drug use. By joining the Texas Air National Guard, I was able to avoid combat duty in Vietnam.   COLLEGE:I graduated from Yale University with a low C average. I was a cheerleader.   PAST WORK EXPERIENCE:I ran for U.S. Congress and lost. I began my career in the oil business in Midland, Texas, in 1975. I bought an oil company, but couldn't find any oil in Texas. I bought the Texas Rangers baseball team in a sweetheart deal that took land using taxpayer money. With the help of my father and our right-wing friends in the oil industry (including Enron CEO Ken Lay), I was elected governor of Texas.   ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS GOVERNOR OF TEXAS:I changed Texas pollution laws to favor power and oil companies, making Texas the most polluted state in the Union. During my tenure, Houston replaced Los Angeles as the most smog-ridden city in America. I cut taxes and bankrupted the Texas treasury to the tune of billions in borrowed money. I set the record for the most executions by any governor in American history. With the help of my brother, the governor of Florida, and my father's appointments to the SupremeCourt, I became President after losing by over 500,000 votes.   ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS PRESIDENT:I am the first President in U.S. history to enter office with acriminal record.&nbsp; I invaded and occupied two countries at a continuing cost of over one billion dollars per week.   ECONOMY:I spent the U.S. surplus and effectively bankrupted the U.S. Treasury. I shattered the record for the largest annual deficit in U.S. history. I set an economic record for most private bankruptcies filed in any 12-month period. I set the all-time record for most foreclosures in a 12-month period. I set the all-time record for the biggest drop in the history of the U.S. stock market.In my first year in office, over 2 million Americans lost their jobs and that trend has continued for the majority of my time in office.   CABINET: I'm proud that the members of my cabinet are the richest of any administration in U.S. history. My 'poorest millionaire,' Condoleeza Rice, has a Chevron oil tanker named after her. I set the record for most campaign fund-raising trips by a U.S. President. I am the all-time U.S. and world record-holder for receiving the most corporate campaign donations.   PRIVILEGE: My largest lifetime campaign contributor, and one of mybest friends, Kenneth Lay, presided over the largest corporate bankruptcy fraud in U.S. history, Enron. My political party used Enron private jets and corporate attorneys to assure my success with the U.S. Supreme Court during my election decision. I have protected myfriends at Enron and Halliburton against investigation or prosecution. More time and money was spent investigating the Monica Lewinsky affair than has been spent investigating one of the biggest corporate rip-offs in history.   CORRUPTION:I presided over the biggest energy crisis in U.S. historyand refused to intervene when corruption involving the oil industry was revealed.&nbsp; I presided over the highest gasoline prices in U.S. history. I changed the U.S. policy to allow convicted criminals to be awarded government contracts. I appointed more convicted criminals to administration than any President in U.S. history.   FOREIGN RELATIONS: I created the Ministry of Homeland Security, the largest bureaucracy in the history of the United States government. I've broken more international treaties than any President in U.S. history.&nbsp; I am the first President in U.S. history to have the United Nations remove the U.S. from the Human Rights Commission. I withdrew the U.S. from the World Court of Law. I refused to allow inspectors access to U.S. 'prisoners of war' detainees and thereby have refused to abide by the Geneva Convention. I am the first President in history to refuse United Nations election inspectors (during the 2002 U.S. election).   ACCESS:I set the record for fewest number of press conferences of any President since the advent of television. I set the all-time record for most days on vacation in any one-year period. After taking off the entire month of August, I resided over the worst security failure in U.S. history.   WORLD IMAGE: I garnered the most sympathy for the U.S. after the World Trade Center attacks and less than a year later made the U.S. the most hated country in the world, the largest failure of diplomacy in world history. I have set the all-time record for most people worldwideto simultaneously protest me in public venues (15 million people), shattering the record for protest against any person in the history of mankind. I am the first President in U.S. history to order an unprovoked, pre-emptive attack and the military occupation of a sovereign nation. I did so against the will of the United Nations, the majority of U.S. citizens, and the world community. I have cut health care benefits for war veterans and support a cut in duty benefits foractive duty troops and their families -- in wartime.   MILITARY INTELLIGENCE: In my State of the Union Address, I lied about our reasons for attacking Iraq, then blamed the lies on our British friends. I am the first President in history to have a majority of Europeans (71%) view my presidency as the biggest threat to world peace and security. I am supporting development of a nuclear 'Tactical Bunker Buster,' a WMD. I have so far failedto fulfill my pledge to bring Osama Bin Laden to justice.   RECORDS AND REFERENCES:  All records of my tenure as governor of Texas are now in my father's library, sealed and unavailable for public view. All records of SEC investigations into my insider trading and my bankrupt companies are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public view. All records or minutes from meetings that I, or my Vice-President, attended regarding public energy policy are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public review.

"2247",2247,589736,"Aries","           John --  Given that if I die her options in life greatly diminish -- and given that others with similar conditions do not have access to the benefits that I can provide, albeit with difficulty -- I will opt for affordable.  That said, I don't consider the two goals (affordability and high quality) necessarily to be mutually exclusive -- but that, as with most things, is a matter of individual conclusions drawn from the available data.  And yes, I do indeed subscribe to a number of absolutes -- while accepting that acting on those absolutes is not entirely effective in all cases, despite the times when I do anyway.  They're also subject not only to change, but to wide variation based on past and future conditions.  I try to adapt and accept that any given conclusion I form may be wrong, but I don't often succeed.  The curse of consciousness:  the only universe I will ever truly know is the one I perceive, physically, mentally, emotionally, or spiritually.  If anything is a recipe for godhood, that's it.  Fraught with unseen dangers, human consciousness is.  That said, I wish there was a Republican I could vote for.  But conservative ideology has replaced judgment; guiding principles have become a careening, unthinking thrillride.  I'd say the same of a Democrat if such was the case; but so far, Kerry has not alarmed me.  Perhaps he will.  To be fair, very likely he will.  We left the altruistic politician (of any ideology) far behind some 200+ years ago (if he or she ever existed at all).  Until either party stops trying to stir its base into a frothy frenzy, the only option available to me is to do my part to keep the pendulum from swinging too far either way.  This administration has swung it too far, too fast.  Any party could have done it.  The pendulum's arc needs to be tempered.  Lacking a leader I can trust, I will opt for tempering until something better comes along.         "

You think something is true or false.  I would bet that you (Johnathan) have more absolutes than realize, and that they help you form your outlook on life and opinion of things.  I think a strong leader has to see the world in absolutes, or else they are not strong.

I'm not asking why you hate George Bush, but why should I consider voting for Kerry?  I have not seen many people excited about voting for him.  I have seen plenty of people seething with hatred toward a man who has led us through a recession, terrorist attack, and massive corporate scandals, to the point that the Federal Reserve had to raise interest rates to 'cool down the economy' (on a side note, I never have understood that reasoning).  I know plenty of people who hate him because he says what he believes and he does (or trys to do) what he says.  I asked Ben that question and got the very honest answer that he really wasn't voting for Kerry but against Bush.  I am probably in the same boat, on the opposite side.  I am a conservative.  I am for small government.  I believe that people are the answer to problems, not government.  I am probably more Libertarian than Republican, but until the Libertarians get off the 'legalize pot' argument as their primary campaign issue, I'll have to settle for the Republicans.  Don't misuderstand me, I think pot should be legalized and regualted, but they make a major PR gaff by making that their primary issue.  George Bush has disappointed me in many ways.  He has introduced some radically liberal, big government, social programs that I disagree with.  But, he has many more of my values than John Kerry.  In fact, I think that I only share one value with John Kerry - we both like living/breathing (as versus being dead).  Add to that the fact the he will not make a stand on an issue (i.e. waffling back and forth), then I have no respect for him at all.  I also like the hypocrisy of the talk of the 'Two Americas', considering his wealth and his running mates wealth.             "

"2262",2262,589736,"Aries","            concerning HVTs, or 'high value targets' such as Osama Bin Laden and other Al Qaeda operatives:   ...Pakistani security officials have been told they must produce HVTs (high-value targets) by the election. According to one source in Pakistan's powerful Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI),  'The Pakistani government is really desperate and wants to flush out bin Laden and his associates after the latest pressures from the U.S. administration to deliver before the [upcoming] U.S. elections.'  Introducing target dates for Al Qaeda captures is a new twist in U.S.-Pakistani counterterrorism relations - according to a recently departed intelligence official, 'no timetable[s]' were discussed in 2002 or 2003 - but the November election is apparently bringing a new deadline pressure to the hunt.   Another official, this one from the Pakistani Interior Ministry, which is responsible for internal security, explains,  'The Musharraf government has a history of rescuing the Bush administration. They now want Musharraf to bail them out when they are facing hard times in the coming elections.'  (These sources insisted on remaining anonymous. Under Pakistan's Official Secrets Act, an official leaking information to the press can be imprisoned for up to ten years.)   A third source, an official who works under ISI's director, Lieutenant General Ehsan ul-Haq, informed tnr that the Pakistanis  'have been told at every level that apprehension or killing of HVTs before [the] election is [an] absolute must.'  What's more, this source claims that Bush administration officials have told their Pakistani counterparts they have a date in mind for announcing this achievement:  'The last ten days of July deadline has been given repeatedly by visitors to Islamabad and during [ul-Haq's] meetings in Washington.'  Says McCormack: 'I'm aware of no such comment.' But according to this ISI official, a White House aide told ul-Haq last spring that  'it would be best if the arrest or killing of [any] HVT were announced on twenty-six, twenty-seven, or twenty-eight July' - the first three days of the Democratic National Convention in Boston.    read the rest of the article  urlLink here .    concerning reports of Iraqi children being held in U.S. detention centers:   'According to information from the International Red Cross,  more than a 100 children are imprisoned in Iraq, including in the infamous prison Abu Ghraib.

'There are some serious unanswered questions,' says Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican on the Armed Services Committee. The Pentagon is stalling on several investigations, and congressional inquiries have ground to a halt. The foot-dragging is astonishing, given that Congress has access to classified documents detailing the abuses outlined by Maj. Gen. Antonio Taguba in his report on Abu Ghraib. Rolling Stone obtained those files in June and offers this report on their contents.  The new classified military documents offer a chilling picture of what happened at Abu Ghraib - including detailed reports that U.S. troops and translators sodomized and raped Iraqi prisoners. The secret files - 106 'annexes' that the Defense Department withheld from the Taguba report last spring - include nearly 6,000 pages of internal Army memos and e-mails, reports on prison riots and escapes, and sworn statements by soldiers, officers, private contractors and detainees. The files depict a prison in complete chaos. Prisoners were fed bug-infested food and forced to live in squalid conditions; detainees and U.S. soldiers alike were killed and wounded in nightly mortar attacks; and loyalists of Saddam Hussein served as guards in the facility, apparently smuggling weapons to prisoners inside.'   read the rest of the article  urlLink here .  i'd warn you in advance about the graphic content, but it should hardly surprise anyone at this point.

Bush.   Nancy Reagan turned down numerous invitations to appear at the Republican National Convention and has warned the Bush campaign she will not tolerate any use of her or her late husbands words or images in the Presidents re-election effort.  Mrs. Reagan does not support President Bushs re-election and neither to most members of the Presidents family, says a spokesman for the former First Lady...  ...The Reagans split with Bush and the party centers around stem cell research which many believe can help find a cure for Alzheimers, the disease that crippled President Reagan in his final years. Bush and the ultra-conservative wing of the Republican Party oppose use of new stem cells. The Reagans, with the exception of Michael [Reagan], support such use.  Theres more to the feud than that, however. Nancy Reagan has told close followers she believes Bush and the current Republican leadership have divided America with their extreme views. She has told Republican leaders she wants nothing to do with the party or Bush.  During the week of Reagans funeral, the former First Lady went ballistic when she learned the Bush campaign was test marketing new ads that used Reagans photos and speeches in an effort to show he supported Bush and his re-election. She personally called Republican Party Chief Ed Gillespie to demand the ads be destroyed.   read the rest of this article  urlLink here ; the 'missing' bit from what i posted here concerns the adopted Reagan son Michael, who does indeed support Bush.

Bush is withdrawing more and more from aides and senior staff, retreating into a private, paranoid world where only the ardent loyalists are welcome.  Cabinet officials, senior White House aides and leaders on Capitol Hill complain privately about the increasing lack of 'face time' with the President and campaign advisors are worried the depressed President may not be up to the rigors of a tough re-election campaign.  'Yes, there are concerns,' a top Republican political advisor admitted privately Wednesday. 'The George W. Bush we see today is not the same, gregarious, back-slapping President of old. He's moody, distrustful and withdrawn.'  Bush's erratic behavior and sharp mood swings led White House physician Col. Richard J. Tubb to put the President on powerful anti-depressant drugs after he stormed off stage rather than answer reporters' questions about his relationship with indicted Enron executive Kenneth J. Lay, but White House insiders say the strong, prescription medications seem to increase Bush's sullen behavior towards those around him.

All of this information can cause stress, memory problems, and difficulty maintaining ones attention and ability to focus. So what do you do? Slim down and start the Information Overload diet! A few tips:    Overcome any reluctance you might have to throwing away files, paper and other things. The fear of discarding something that might be useful later-much, much later-holds back many of us from getting rid of stuff well never use.   Develop good habits. For example, handle your paper work at the same time each day, look at what is in your in-box no more than twice a day, etc.   Find a planning system that works for you. Whether its a binder to carry your planning pages, wireless phone, and handheld, or software to keep all your information synched together, FranklinCovey offers hundreds of solutions to keep you organized and productive.

When you hear the first whispering of conscience, youll either act in harmony with it, or immediately begin to rationalize making another choice. Choosing the first option will bring you inner peace.

Here's a brief excerpt:    Mac Carter feels like a hero. As a HR administrator for a nationwide retailer, he has opportunities to serve people in a variety of capacities. But never has he felt better about helping someone than he does now.   Mac has a daughter in the Girl Scouts and while at a function with her, he met the father of one of the other kids. They got to talking over cookies and punch, and Mac learned the man was an unemployed distribution manager. Knowing that his company was in need of distribution management, Mac gave him the name and phone number of a department head that had hiring authority with his company. Within days the man called to express his gratitude, explaining their situation was fast becoming desperate. It made Mac feel good to know that he helped this man to find a job and helped his company to meet a need at the same time.  This scenario is illustrative of a typical networking success. It demonstrates the power of having contacts. The rule of 'who you know' has long been a key job search component. Statistics have consistently shown that over 80 percent of jobs never get advertised because they are filled through the vague technique of 'networking.'       "

There is also the benefit of meeting someone 'cold' at the library, for example.  I met a young man who knows someone from a local Dayton company, and he gave me that person's information so that I can contact her.  But the great thing about networking is that it's a Win/Win situation.  I need to look for some way to help someone else in addition to my getting help.  To be honest, it's been difficult to keep that perspective when I'm eagerly looking for a job.  Even then, I need to keep in mind that someone will be hiring me because of skills that I can contribute to make them money.    "

A few tips to treat yourself and your body:    Physical:   Get a good night's sleep, play your favorite outdoor sport or activity, and enjoy a well-balanced meal.   Social/Emotional:   Call a friend you haven't seen in a while, volunteer time to charity, or do something nice for someone--anonymously.   Mental:   Visit a library or museum, solve a brainteaser, puzzle or riddle, or watch an educational show on TV.   Spiritual:    Spend some time in nature, research your genealogy, or go on a personal 'retreat' (like a spa) to rejuvenate yourself. Benefiting your mind and body - a solo act!    "

Outside the Web, lie USENET newsgroups, mailing lists, and a number of other modalities or protocols, as they are called. Many employers find these protocols  especially newsgroups  more effective than the Web, when they're searching for employees, most particularly when they're searching for technical employees. So it is to newsgroups you must go, and not just to the Web, if you're interested in those employers' job listings.  There are newsgroup metasearch sites (on the Web, paradoxically) that will allow you to search a number of these newsgroups or a number of Mailing Lists all at once, rather than having to go to each newsgroup one by one.    urlLink Google Groups  has messages from several thousand newsgroups. If it's job listings you're looking for, just type in your query, like: jobs AND Bay Area and it will give you the actual job listings that match, in reverse order (most recent, first).

Job-hunting expenses are deductible. If you're out of work, or even if you're still employed but looking for a new job, all of your job hunting expenses are deductible as miscellaneous itemized deductions. Such expenses would include resumes, phone calls, postage, travel costs and any other expenses related to your attempt to get a new job. If youve done a lot of driving in your job search in 2002, you can deduct mileage for your 2002 return at a rate of 36.5 cents a mile. For 2003, the mileage rate falls to 36 cents a mile.

It will be of far more use to you than to be able to read Latin.' -- Charles Haddon Spurgeon 'A 'no' uttered from the deepest conviction is better than a 'yes' merely uttered to please, or what is worse, to avoid trouble.' -- Mahatma Ghandi 'When your daily activities are in concert with your highest priorities, you have a credible claim to inner peace.' -- Hyrum Smith   No Thank You   No.  Nicht.  Nulle.  No matter how it comes out, saying 'no' isn't always easy.  Project overload, interruptions, and demanding coworkers can make it tough to speak this language.  Remember, you have a right to say no... graciously but firmly.  If you respond evasively, you'll build false expectations.  Saying no takes practice.  Here are some phrases that might help:  'I have so much on my plate now that I don't know when I can get to it.  But I do know someone over here who can help you now.' 'Sure, I can help you with your request as long as we both understand that what I agreed to do for you yesterday might be delayed.' 'Thanks for thinking about me, but no thanks.' 'I won't be able to do it until tomorrow, but I could provide you with some resources that might help you do it today.'     "

You know, your Emotional Bank Accounts -- the trust you have built up in your different relationships.  Still waiting for a 'statement' to arrive?  Here's one:  If you don't know, you're probably overdrawn!  Maintaining a reserve of trust in relationships requires constant investing.  Consider this advice:   Bad checks .  What you consider to be a deposit (like going to the movies when your date wants to talk) may actually be a withdrawal for others.  They can't collect on your efforts because it does not meet their actual needs.  Really understanding others is key to building trust.  Pocket change . Showing respect, kindness, and courtesy may seem like small deposits, but over time they compound and increase your reserve.  Neglecting the little things will soon have you in the red.  Count on me .  Breaking commitments or promises often can bankrupt you.  Keeping them is the best way to save for a rainy day in any relationship. Rich relationships -- what a great payoff!    "

'Hey, you!  Go for this and go for that.'  It's pretty hard to supervise even one person when you are involved in every move he/she makes.  Effective delegation focuses on results, not methods, and allows others to use their imagination, free will, and conscience to get the job done.  Here's some advice:   Desired Results.  Clearly articulate what needs to be done, not how to do it.  Describe in detail the desired result so that the other person virtually sees it.  Guidelines.  Make sure there are parameters within which people are to operate.  Point out potential failure paths -- what not to do versus what to do.  Resources.  Help people understand what human, financial, technical, or organizational resources are available to them.  Accountability.  Set up standards of performance that will be used in evaluating results and when those evaluations will occur.  Consequences.  Specify what will happen, both good and bad, as a result of the evaluation. Effective delegation -- gofer it!    "

"2527",2527,449628,"Aries","        Effectiveness Tip of the Week   via email from the folks at  urlLink FranklinCovey     I Do   This Information Age can make you believe that knowing really is doing.  But doing requires, well, DOING something!  Many times there's a gap between knowing and doing.  Yet, once you close the gap and unite knowing and doing, sparks really fly!  Do I hear bells?  Repeat after me: 'I affirm the special bond and unique relationship that exists between knowing and doing and promise to keep it alive always.' (Sniffle!)  Here's some advice:   Details.   Planning is essential for converting ideas into action.  But don't get hung up on details, wasting precious time and resources debating specifics of strategy and implementation.  View plans like blueprints -- where you focus on essentials and leave room for adjustments.  Embrace technology.   Technology produces new tools for getting things done in a changing world.  Seek every opportunity at work and at home to learn and use these tools.  Risky business.   Fear of failing may prevent you from doing a lot of things, yet knowing comes from doing.  Be more willing to tackle risk in your life.  You'll never know until you try! I now pronounce you... umm... more effective!    "

"2531",2531,449628,"Aries","        More Networking Stuff   Yesterday my wife, daughter, and I went bowling at a local bowling alley, caled Bowlero (cute name).  It was set up as a Family Fun time by the events coordinator at Keisha's school.  We got to play for a discounted price, and it was Bumper Bowling.  Needless to say, my bowling average didn't improve by that much!  What does this have to do with networking?  As we're getting ready to leave, I started talking with another father about his child and what he does for a living.  Well, I had also brought some business cards I made for myself, and I gave him and his friend a card.  We also saw one of my daughter's classmates with his mother.  We've been wanting to keep in touch with his parents, so I gave my wife a card to give her, along with some paper so that we could get her phone number as well.  It's  this  aspect of the job search that I enjoy the most.  It does provide immediate results, but it plants seeds that may someday come to fruition.    "
"2532",2532,449628,"Aries","        I guess you could call THAT networking   This morning a representative from the local gas delivery company came by to our place.  He stated that he'd been ordered to either collect a certain past due amount of money from us or shut off our service.  I explained to him our family's current situation, and he, while very sympathetic, explained that it would be better for us to not have it shut off and then reconnected again.  Fortunately, we had the amount in the bank account.  Mom was outside with us as well.  I asked if he could take a check, and then went inside to get the checkbook.  I returned to the representative with the checkbook and wrote the check for the past due amount.  I also told him that I was grateful that they hadn't turned the service off when the weather was cold, like it was last month.  The, get this:  he asked me what kind of work I did.  I told him that I did some computer programming, and he said that he might know of someone who could help me.  I asked him if I could give him a business card.  He said yes, and I went back inside to get some business cards I'd made up for myself.  I gave him two of them, in fact.  As the rep took off, Mom mentioned that the guy told her I'd been a lot better than many of the folks he's had to meet about similar matters like this.  Mom thanked him and they got to talking about my being a Christian, and the guy said he could tell I was a Christian by how I'd behaved.  So, I  guess  you could consider that networking.    "

You can use a questionnaire or just chat on the phone.  You know what's best for you.  Ingredients.   Be careful not to judge each other's character.  Feedback should be objective, and given against performance and effectiveness criteria.  Dish it out.   As soon as you receive feedback, analyze it and feed it back!  Involve others in creating an action plan based on their feedback.  Remember your manner and always say 'Thanks.' Come on, try it.  You'll like it!    "

Clarifying expectations in your family, work, and other relationships will help avoid misunderstandings, disappointments, and lack of trust.   Implicit vs. explicit.   Some expectations in relationships are implicit, like your boss expecting you to be at work on time.   Yet, many expectations are explicit, requiring further clarification.  Negative situations are created when you assume your expectations are self-evident and clearly understood by others.  Speak up.   In new relationships, get all the expectation out on the table at the beginning.  Clearly articulate who does what.  Almost all relationship difficulties are a result of ambiguous expectations around roles and goals.  Time and effort.   It's easy to pretend differences don't exist and to hope things will work out.  Investing time and effort up front to clarify expectations will save time and effort in the future. Clarifying expectations -- any questions?    "

"2558",2558,449628,"Aries","        Organize and Document   lessons from the past tax filing year   I'd like to share some things I've learned from doing our family's taxes last week.  The main purpose in doing this is to get this stuff down so that I don't forget.  I also invite your input.  If I could sum it up in a word or phrase it would be Documentation and Organization.  I rememember when I worked as an Environmental Engineer for Alcoa Building Products, documentation was key to showing our proof that we complied with environmental laws and regulations.   If it wasn't in writing, then it never happened .  With that mindset, we needed to have well-organized files.  I remember the color scheme for the different types of environmental 'media' (for lack of a better word): blue for water/wastewater, green for solid/hazardous waste, orange for toxic chemical information, red for air resource management, and so on.  We even had a document that described our file-keeping system.  The intent of this was to provide quick and easy retrieval of documentation in the event of an audit and for future reporting.  Our family has a number of things going on that merit good recordkeeping practices.  For one thing, both my wife and I are actively looking for employment.  Mileage and other job search expenses are tax-deductible, provided you have documentation.  And we need to keep track of contacts, companies to whom we've sent resumes, follow up correspondence, and so on.  Additionally, our daughter Keisha, has hearing loss in both ears.  Several times we've needed to provide documentation for insurance, education, and medical reasons.  And then there's the bills.  Holy cow!  Bills for everything related to running a family.  There is a huge need to document that bills were paid, along with conversations with creditors and other individuals.  I think a big reason why I've procrastinated in the past is because I've dreaded all the effort in getting this information together.  I see now that if I put forth the work up front to get organized and document things, then, when the time comes to retrieve that information, it won't appear as daunting.  So, you could say that I'm having another kind of a 'birthday' today.    "

Perhaps you have taken some time lately to reflect on what resonates within you -- those ideas and convictions that need no outside validation.  Because of demands on your time, you might not contemplate your values as often as you would like as you go about living.  Yet it's important to make a conscious connection with those values that govern your life -- the foundations upon which your life is both anchored and navigated; things like family, humor, and respect.  To help you explore your values further, try this exercise:  Locate a comfortable environment free from noise and distractions.  Reflect on the following questions and listen to your heart and conscience.  If I had to walk away from everything I ever loved, what would be left behind? What would I miss most if it were taken from me? What is of greatest importance or value in my life? As you go about your week, it will be vitally important to determine whether or not there is consistency between where you spend your time and what you value most.    "

I had a meeting with the president of the local bartending school here in Dayton yesterday.  I think I would make a good bartender -- mixologist, to be more accurate.  I have an outgoing personality, and I had a chemistry set when I was growing up.  Well, I never got the $300 microscope when I was 7 years old (that was in 1977 dollars, by the way).  Alas, I digress.  The meeting went very well, up until she mentioned the tuition.  See, trying to live off unemployment has been hard to begin with.  Then laying out several hundreds of dollars up front for tuition... well, the bubble went 'pop'.  I went away, feeling a little bit downhearted.  But I think that the school might be able to work with me on the tuition.  After all, it's a two-week course, and the tuition is based on what an average weekly take-home pay for a bartender would be.  So, in two weeks, I'd theoretically be able to make up the money I spent toward tuition.  We'll see.  I'm going to talk with her again on Monday afternoon.  Hopefully, I'll be able to start the class that Monday, too.  Stay tuned!    "

The items allow small businesses to write off $100,000 in investments this year. All businesses could depreciate half their assets this year, recouping their money faster. For example, Luscombe said, a small business that spends $150,000 on new equipment this year can write off $100,000 immediately and recoup half of the remaining expense through depreciation this year.

"2614",2614,449628,"Aries","        Thoughts on the Job Fair   I attended a job fair at the Dayton Job Center this past Wednesday, April 30, 2003.  I've spent a lot more time at the Job Center lately, searching for a job and getting set up with other services.  Last fall, I attended another job fair at the Job Center as well.  I wasn't sure exactly what to expect.  I knew from attending the job fair last fall that there were sure to be a lot of people there.  I also expected that there would be a lot of organizations looking for people in the health care fields.  Both of these expectations were met.  I felt that there were so many people at the job fair that it was hard to be in a one-on-one conversation with any recruiter for very long.  I noticed a long line of people waiting to talk to recruiters from one company in particular.  Since my wife Jennie has been ill lately and was not able to attend the job fair, I used the opportunity to network a little bit with the health care companies that were looking for nurses asisstants.  I also went to see which companies would be looking for people in my field.  I saw a few of them.  Yet, when I talked to company representatives in person, their recommendation was still to send my resume via the company's website or via email.  I still wonder why these companies were present at the job fair at all if they were just going to ask me to send my resume to the company electronically.  As I left the job fair, I was encouraged to chat with another job seeker who was looking for a job in accounting.  We used the opportunity to network and share our thoughts on the job fair.  I still believe that job fairs are great ways to meet companies and network with other job seekers, and I look forward to attending others in the future.    "
"2615",2615,449628,"Aries","        Effectiveness Tip of the Week   via email from the folks at  urlLink FranklinCovey     Push Pause   Youve put in 8+ hours at the office; attended a PTA meeting, soccer practice, and/or a doctors appointment; and now youre in the midst of helping with homework, feeding the dog, and clearing out the answering machine.  Its high time for a time-out.  A walk?  A movie?  Nowbefore you scoff at the notion and claim it would take a sheer miracle to find extra time for that time-out, realize that it is well worth it.  Taking a moment to yourself reduces stress and leaves you refreshed and focused, not irritable and distracted.  Youll feel better and have a fresh outlook to tackle all the tasks that are waiting for you.  A few tips:  Your time-out doesnt have to be something big. Sit on the porch and enjoy a lemonade, take a small hike, or lounge on the couch with a magazine. If evenings are hectic, try waking up 30 minutes earlier to soak in the tub, walk the dog, or savor a warm drink. Do not get distracted. If your family is around, tell them theyre in charge of answering the door, the phone, and that, unless its an emergency, youre off duty for a few minutes.

"2658",2658,449628,"Aries","        Job Search Frustrations   Today, on the way from my therapist appointment, I saw that the Longhorn restaurant on Dorothy Lane had just opened.  I went inside to get an application.  One of the managers told me to come back at 2 PM this afternoon so that we could talk about a bartending position.  I filled out the application, and got changed for the interview.  When I arrived at the restaurant, the gentleman with whom I spoke earlier wasn't available.  I talked with another manager/partner, who told me, 'If you had only been here 3 weeks ago...'  This was not what I needed to hear, but I finished the meeting gracefully.  Then I went to the bartending school just to check in.  The manager there told me to call her back before 5 PM today.  I then went to 'Restaurant Row' along Miller Lane to obtain and complete applications at restaurants I had not previously applied to earlier.  It was a 'learning experience.'  Many of these restaurants do not hire bartenders, but instead hire servers who later get 'promoted' to bartenders.  I told one proprietor of a certain 'Austrailian-themed' restaurant that I was willing to be a server, but he basically said that, unless I had 2 to 3 years of experience serving I shouldn't even consider completing an application for his restaurant.  I asked him if he knew where I could go to get this experience he was looking for.  He didn't have any idea.  I was very upset and frustrated at what he said, and my whole saga of finding a job, by this time.  He offered his hand for me to shake, and, at first, I didn't want to do it, but I resisted the urge to be rude and shook it anyway.  As I walked out, I thought about getting some rotten eggs and returning to the restaurants.  I won't, though.  I came home and vented.  You may be aware that I have a blog called ' urlLink Letters to God .'  It is a great way for me to pray, and I feel better for having done it.  Much better than I would have if I, say, found some rotten eggs, if you know what I mean.  I could probably continue this post for a little while, but I guess I'll end it here.  Let me encourage you to share your frustrations.  Write them down, share with a friend or confidant, send an email - just be open with it so that you can feel better.

I recalled reading the story some time ago, and on a hunch I checked out  urlLink Snopes.com  to see if it was a true story.   urlLink They couldn't really determine whether it was or not, but claim that certain details of the story are suspect .  At the same time they agree that there is no harm in enjoying the story.  I prefer the version that Karen posted because it doesn't contain as much profanity as the one on the  urlLink Snopes.com page  does.  So, without further ado, here it is: This is even funnier when you realize it's real! Next time you have a bad day at work, think of this guy.  Rob is a commercial saturation diver for Global Divers in Louisiana.  He performs underwater repairs on offshore drilling rigs.  Below is an E-mail he sent to his sister. She then sent it to radio station 103.2 on FM dial in Ft. Wayne, Indiana, who was sponsoring a worst job experience contest. Needless to say, she won. Hi Sue,  Just another note from your bottom-dwelling brother.  Last week I had a bad day at the office.  I know you've been feeling down lately at work, so I thought I would share my dilemma with you to make you realize it's not so bad after all.  Before I can tell you what happened to me, I first must bore you with a few technicalities of my job.  As you know, my office lies at the bottom of the sea.  I wear a suit to the office.  It's a wet suit.  This time of year the water is quite cool. So what we do to keep warm is this:  We have a diesel powered industrial water heater.  This $20,000 piece of equipment sucks the water out of the sea.  It heats it to a delightful temperature.  It then pumps it down to the diver through a garden hose, which is taped to the air hose.  Now this sounds like a darn good plan, and I've used it several times with no complaints.  What I do, when I get to the bottom and start working, is take the hose and stuff it down the back of my wet suit.  This floods whole suit with warm water.  It's like working in a Jacuzzi.  Everything was going well until all of a sudden, my butt started to itch.  So, of course, I scratched it.  This only made things worse. Within a few seconds my butt started to burn.   I pulled the hose out from my back, but the damage was done.  In agony I realized what had happened.  The hot water machine had sucked up a jellyfish and pumped it into my suit.  Now, since I don't have any hair on my back, the jellyfish couldn't stick to it.  However, the crack of my butt was not as fortunate.  When I scratched what I thought was an itch, I was actually grinding the jellyfish into the crack of my butt.  I informed the dive supervisor of my dilemma over the communicator.  His instructions were unclear due to the fact that he, along with five other divers, were all laughing hysterically.  Needless to say I aborted the dive.  I was instructed to make three agonizing in-water decompression stops totaling thirty-five minutes before I could reach the surface to begin my chamber dry decompression.  When I arrived at the surface, I was wearing nothing but my brass helmet.  As I climbed out of the water, the medic, with tears of laughter running down his face, handed me a tube of cream and told me to rub it on my butt as soon as I got in the chamber. The cream put the fire out, but I couldn't poop for two days because my butt was swollen shut.  So, next time you're having a bad day at work, think about how much worse it would be if you had a jellyfish shoved up your butt. Now repeat to yourself, 'I love my job, I love my job, I love my job.       "

"2675",2675,449628,"Aries","        The Balancing Act   Compared to 25 years ago, the typical family puts in 1,000 more hours a year at work and more than 8 million of us work two or more jobs.  So it's no wonder that finding a balance between work and life is difficult.  But balance is essential to our well-being and our ability to perform well at home and at work.  Here are five ways to get a better footing:   Simplify.   Need help with housecleaning?  Consider hiring a cleaning person once a week.  Feel like you don't have time?  Say 'no' to things you don't want to do or don't have time to do.  Be grateful. Even in the midst of the most hectic and stressful times of life, there are things for which we can be thankful.  Reflecting on the good things in our lives helps keep an all-important balance in our outlook.  Be a kid and play.   Get down in the dirt and help the kids make mud pies, watch a movie with them, or have a long chat over coffee with your teen.  Give your family one-on-one time.  Pay attention to yourself.   If you don't stay healthy, you'll be less able to handle the stress of work and home.  Stop procrastinating.   It takes more energy fretting over not doing a project than actually doing it.  So save your energy for better things and just get started.     Source: Ragan Communications      "

He talks a lot about the Jobs and Growth Act of 2003, which he recently signed into law: ... Next week, the United States Treasury will begin printing and mailing more than 25 million child tax credit checks, putting over $12 billion back into the hands of American families. These rebates are the result of the Jobs and Growth Act I recently signed into law, which increases the child tax credit from $600 to $1,000 per child. And because this new law reduced income tax rates, businesses earlier this month lowered tax withholding for worker paychecks. Now, those workers and their families have a lighter tax bill and more take-home pay...  ... My administration remains focused on faster economic growth that will translate into more jobs. Now that Americans can keep more of what they earn, we can expect to see rising demand for goods and services. And as demand increases, companies will need more workers to meet it...  ... Government does not create prosperity. Government can, however, create the conditions that make prosperity possible. The Jobs and Growth Act of 2003 was based on the fundamental faith in the energy and creativity of the American people. With hard work and daily determination, entrepreneurs and workers are moving this economy forward. The American economy is headed in the right direction, and we can be confident of better days ahead.     "

The nation's economy grew faster than expected in the second quarter.  ...  Yet this week's employment report also shows that many Americans who want to work are still having trouble finding a job. My administration is acting to promote faster growth to encourage the creation of new jobs. The key to job growth is higher demand for goods and services. With higher demand, businesses are more likely to hire new employees.  The best way to promote growth and job creation is to leave more money in the pockets of households and small businesses, instead of taxing it away. So we lowered income tax rates, cut taxes on dividends and capital gains, reduced the marriage penalty and increased the child tax credit. This week, the checks for up to $400 per child started arriving in the mailboxes of American families. That money will help American families move the economy forward.  We have also taken action to help small businesses, who are the job creators of America. We increased tax incentives for equipment purchases, giving small businesses an additional reason to invest. More orders for machinery and equipment means more jobs. And more business investment can lead to greater worker productivity, which helps raise worker wages.  We are starting to see results from our actions. My administration's economists believe that if we had not passed tax relief, our unemployment rate would have been nearly one percentage point higher, and as many as 1.5 million Americans would not have the jobs they have today.  ...  America's economy has challenges, and I will not be satisfied until every American looking for work can find a job. By steady, persistent action, we are preparing the way for vigorous growth and more jobs. I have confidence in our economic future, because I have confidence in the people whose effort and creativity make this economy run -- the workers and the entrepreneurs of America.     "

Their hard work strengthens the economy,  creates most of the new jobs in America , and supplies the innovation that drives our future prosperity. As we mark National Small Business Week, our nation honors the enterprise and hard work of small business owners and employees.  Small businesses are a key to upward mobility, particularly for women and minorities. There are over 3 million minority-owned small businesses across America, and that number is rising. And women-owned businesses now employ more than 9 million Americans. For the sake of all small businesses and our entire economy, my administration is pursuing an aggressive pro-growth,  pro-jobs  agenda.  The tax relief I have signed since I took office will save 25 million small business owners an average of more than $2,800 this year. Income tax relief is particularly helpful for business owners who pay their business taxes at their individual income tax rates.  We have reduced the burden of unnecessary regulation on small businesses, and we have passed much needed incentives for investment and new equipment, which will help our small businesses grow and  create high-paying jobs .  These policies are working. A recent survey of small businesses shows rising optimism among owners, evidence of improving sales, and  more plans to invest and hire new workers . This is good news for our communities and  good news for people looking for work . The President then continues, 'Still, there is more to be done. I have proposed a six-point plan to  create jobs , strengthen small businesses and build employer confidence.'  Let's hear it for the small business owners and their employees!    "

"2721",2721,449628,"Aries","        More Readers' Comments   Sandra posted a comment to  urlLink last week's post about Interviewers' Pet Peeves : I think that employers are overly-scrutinizing prospective employees in this day and time. The fact that recruiters have access to their potential employees whole life history is a violation of personal freedom. Criminal backround checks, for example, should notify the employer if the person is a murderer, a bank robber, or a rapist. In light of technological advances, an employer may look at a minor offense on the prospective employee's record as a reflection of the way that person is, no matter if they have changed or not.  I think employers should be trained to be more empathetic when making a decision on whether or not to hire. I also think that employers shouldn't have the right to inspect a person's history that isn't relevant to the future job. For example, if a rapist applies for a job taking care of people, the answer of course would be 'no'. If a bank robber applies for as a cashier, the answer again: 'no'. However, if a person who has a history of drunken driving applies for a job as a janitor then the fact that the drunken driving record has no relevance to the job applied for then the history sould be taken note on but shouldn't interfere with the chance of getting the job, unless of course the job involves driving, if the person hasn't been through some sort of rehabilitation.

It was great to take the bus where I needed to go and not have to pay attention to traffic, etc.  For my first job out of college, I travelled one hour one way to work for almost three years.  When I got a consulting job, we moved halfway between the consulting territory, yet I still had assignments that meant at least a 40-minute commute.  Of course, if you work from home or telecommute, your commuting time is only the time from the bedroom to the office or wherever you do your work!    "

But I soon realized that it would be an extreme test of endurance and stamina.  After a full day of school on Friday, which began at 7 AM, I went to a part-time job at a hardware store from 5 PM to 9 PM.

"2803",2803,449628,"Aries","         urlLink Psychological Tests Becoming Big at Work    A recent study states that one in three employers is using these tests in the hiring process.   urlLink ABCNews has the details...   And here's a quote from the article: Long popular in Europe, the tests are now becoming more common among U.S. and multi-national firms keen on determining what kind of workers their employees are, how well they'll get a long with others and whether or not they're suited for a particular job. Some other headings in the article include   Top to the Bottom Testing , which talks about how these tests are being administered for CEO candidates as well as sales associates for a retail chain;  Seeking the Emotionally Intelligent , which describes how tests are being done to assess a candidates disposition and how he or she may work with others;  The Writing's on the Application , which shares how some companies are using handwriting analysis to 'help weed out applicants who might be untrustworthy, or to hire people who have qualities like integrity or reliability.' For the job seeker this presents some challenges.  When I went through job outplacement, I was taught how to answer interviewing questions in a way that would project a positive impression of myself to the interviewer.  For example, one of the common questions was about my biggest weakness.  The way to answer this question is to talk about a weakness and turn it into a potential strength.  I would think that the best strategy for these psychological tests is to be completely honest in answering the questions.  Trying to answer a question based on what you think the employer wants to hear may not be in your best interest.  In addition, it's difficult to discern how a potential employer will use the results of such tests.  They may perceive answers to questions differently from how you do, for example.  Just be honest and do your best.    "

"2814",2814,449628,"Aries","        Five Myths About Holiday Job Hunting    via an emailed newsletter from  urlLink Execs-Direct.com      by Sinara Stull O'Donnell   When I was an executive and a corporate recruiter, I found that December was my busiest and most stressful month. It's no exaggeration to say I often made job offers on Christmas Eve and came in the day after Christmas to do the paperwork so that an employee could start Jan. 2.  Yet, the misconception that nobody hires in December is common, as is the poor advice that 'you might as well take the month off.' It may seem counterintuitive, but the opposite is true.  Holiday job-search myths have been around for a long time and are repeated like mantras, but shatter when scrutinized. Consider the following:   Myth No.1: 'Nobody hires in December'   December is still a month employees are being paid to work. There are five reasons companies may hire in December:  Many companies must spend the money in their budgets before the end of the year. Hiring 'heats up in December because hiring managers are trying to reach deadlines to use budgets,' says Susie Basanda, principal of Basanda Consulting, a recruitment management company in Ventura County, Calif. People tend to want to tie up loose ends before the new year. Hiring managers, human-resource representatives and executive recruiters are like the rest of us who have that feeling of urgency as the year-end approaches. If there are unfilled positions on their staffs, hiring managers naturally want to fill them. Positions open up in late November or early December because many professionals quit their jobs this time of year. As David Knowles, a senior recruiter with Excel Unlimited, an executive search firm in Houston, says, 'The holidays can bring on a time of longing to be closer to family, roots and people. If no bonus is involved, people often will quit Dec. 1, and give two weeks notice so that they can be with family for the holidays.' Headhunters are more motivated to place candidates before the end of the year. Almost all executive recruiters are paid on commission. This commission is based on fees their company earns for placing professionals. What helps the December job seeker is that this commission rises based on overall yearly billing. One might start the year at 30% and graduate to 60% by December. The catch is that it goes down to 30% again Jan. 1. Strong companies often want to start the new year with a bang. 'Companies that are forecasting profits want to have key people in place to start the year off well,' says Knowles.  Myth No. 2: 'You won't find the job you really want in December'   You're just as likely to find the job you really want in December as in any other month. One reason is because you won't have as much competition, says Judy Kneisley, senior vice president and general manager for outplacement firm Lee Hecht Harrison Inc. 'Because so many people believe in the myths, it's a perfect time to be out there,' she says. It may sound logical that only losers would be desperate enough to look for jobs during the holidays, says Knowles, but 'the fact is that winners are looking in December.' Winners don't give up.   Myth No. 3: 'Nothing ever happens after Dec. 15, so you might as well leave town'   Most recruiters advise job candidates to be flexible in scheduling interviews and meetings around the holidays. Eberhart goes a step further and advises candidates to avoid taking weeklong trips during the holidays. Basanda once held a round of interviews New Year's Day.    Myth No. 4: 'Even if an employer has an opening, the hiring manager won't have time to meet with you'   The interviewing process can be slower during the holidays because of the number of days people are out of the office. But, as Basanda says, the process 'will slow down but it doesn't stop.'   Myth No. 5: 'You'll have a better chance if you wait until the first of the year'   If employers have a need, they don't care whether it's January or December. '[Hiring] isn't focused on the time of year. It's focused on need,' says Keith Mills, vice president for Aaron's Automotive, a manufacturer in Springfield, Mo.

'I would visit whenever I went back to the West Coast and have dinner with him when he came to New York,' said Potter.   Potter also built a strong network in and around New York City.   'A former colleague from a local agency called me and told me about the opening, and I sent my resume in. She talked me up to her bosses and they reviewed my resume. It turned out that they knew my previous employer,' said Potter.   'I had two strong references going for me -- a former colleague and a former boss.

I was doing my daily job search at my local workforce one in Florida, and I stumbled across this website, which I'd never heard of before. I decided to check this site out, and I found a position called yacht finance specialist (a.k.a administrative assistant). The funny thing about this position was it posted on August 18, 2003, and it was still on their site on November 12, 2003. I called the employer, and the reason why they did not find anyone was because none of the other candidates had passed the credit check. The company is owned by a bank, and passing a credit check is required.  In the post to which Sue responded, we posed some specific questions.

When it comes to finding your passion in your career, there's no way around it. Self-exploration is where it all starts.   Want a short, simple way to squeeze exponentially more insights from those self-exploration efforts? The secret word o' the day is...  'Why?'  Just that one little word, vigorously applied, will give you incredible insights.   For example, take a look at a commonly recommended question for finding your career passion...'What do you love doing?'   A valuable question, but by itself it falls far short of the insights that could be gotten by following the answers up with, 'why?'   Because 'what' you love doing isn't the whole story. You can say, 'I love doing _____,' but whether you're conscious of it or not, what you really mean is 'I love doing _____ because _____, _____, and _____.' You and I could say we love the exact same thing, and the underlying reasons might be completely different.   Asking 'Why? What is it about it that is so enjoyable?' lets you dig down and find the underlying characteristics of the things you love doing. Once you know those, you can start trying to incorporate them into your career, whether by making small changes where you are, or identifying a whole new direction.      "

Well, back in the day, it was just not as difficult to track the old job search.  A binder, a spreadsheet, even your Sent Mail folder would do.  When I embarked upon my most recent job search, just over a year ago, I realized that none of these methods were quite right. I kept bookmarking job descriptions on the big job boards, only to go back later to find they had been removed. In order to better track the specifics of the jobs I was applying to, I ended up developing a very simple web-based job tracking system where I could store all of the job related information in one place (including the resume and cover letter I sent it), and retrieve it on demand.  After using the application for several months, I turned it into a free public job portal so that anyone can use it.   With all of the job related web sites out there, I'm surprised that no one has done this until now.  The closest thing I've seen has been on private career center sites which provide some job search tools for their paid clientele.  Other than that, there are some sites that let you track the jobs you applied to through their interface, but none of them let you track all of your job inquiries, regardless of source.  If you've seen anything else like it out there, please let me know.  Also, if you'd like to share how you're tracking your current job search, please add a comment below.     "

While there are many blogging tools out there, I find that I have become very fond of the free   urlLink BLOGGER  service for most of my blogging needs, ever since  urlLink Google   acquired them and added the Blog button to the  urlLink Google Toolbar .  What this does is allow you to add web pages, with comments, directly to your blog from whatever site you are on with the push of a button.  For example, suppose you see a job listing in your local newsgroup.   The logical thing to do would be to go to the employer's site and see whether or not the job is listed there.  Now here's where Blogging can come in handy.  Say you are ready to apply for the job immediately - it's easy enough just to send in your resume and store all of the information in your Jobfiler job tracker.  But suppose you aren't ready to apply - you need to revise your resume, or get your cover letter in order, or simply think about it.  If you had a job search related Blog, you would simply blog that page, add whatever notes you want to associate with that job, and post it to your blog.  Your blog would then become a running job search diary, which you can even add follow up comments to any single entry.  Some things to consider...  if you are blogging your job search for your own records, it's important to set up the blog as PRIVATE (not publically available).  Of course, there are folks who blog their search publically, but that's really a judgement call on your part.  Anything you post in the public domain could come back to bite you.  Read this article on Blogger about the guy that got fired over his blog.   How-To's (skip this if you're not trying to set your blog to Private) When you  urlLink create your account on Blogger  , you can specify whether the blog is public or private. If you mark it as 'Private' and want to keep it that way, you should also add the robots meta tag in the header of your template (and if you FTP to your own directory, placing the robots.txt file in the root is also a good idea).  And of course, set your options on Blogger to Ping Weblogs = No.  Here are some sample jobsearch blogs which I have found on the web:  urlLink Trey's Job Search   urlLink All About Jen   urlLink Mike McBride: Life of a one-man IT Department   On a related note, here are some jobsearch information blogs, offering advice, articles, etc.  urlLink The Job Files   urlLink http://bostonworks.boston.com/blog/   urlLink Not Working for a Living   urlLink The Monster Blog   urlLink Being Bold   And for those of you who would like an alternative solution to Blogger, here are some other ways to get your blog up and running in a short amount of time:  urlLink BBlog   urlLink Square Space   urlLink eBloggy   Good luck, and happy hunting!

"2865",2865,449628,"Aries","         urlLink Yahoo! News - Consumer Sentiment Highest Since Nov 2000    I think I understand it now.  Evidence shows that the tax cuts passed by Congress and signed into law by President Bush have been good for the economy and job seekers.  As consumer sentiment gets better, the demand for goods and services grows.  The higher demand for goods and services means that companies work to provide for those demands.  This means investing money into hiring new workers, for one thing.  From the article (emphasis added): The confidence data helped ease worries that the labor market's slow recovery might undermine consumer spending, which makes up two-thirds of economic activity in the United States.   Consumers' hearty spending over the past few years, helped by  tax cuts  and low interest rates, has  helped keep the economy from suffering a sharper downturn .   Economists said a variety of factors likely boosted confidence: the holidays passing without any attacks, the rise in stock indexes to nearly two-year highs,  coming tax refunds  and an end to big layoffs.

I made that statement yesterday at a gathering of other job seekers at  urlLink Sinclair Community College .  A brief history of my education and experience:  I have a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering I was an Environmental Engineer doing environmental management for a manufacturing company I was a programmer/consultant I am a bartender for a hotel and conference center I remember when I met with the guidance counselor in high school, he told me that he could see me doing a number of different kinds of jobs, based on the talents and aptitude he'd seen in me.  I had dreamed of becoming a Renaissance Man back then.  I don't know if I've found something that fits just yet.  To quote  urlLink U2 , 'I still haven't found what I'm looking for.'  At the same time, I realize that no job is going to be a perfect fit.  There are always going to be times when the passion wanes, when there is other 'non-fun' work to be done, too.  I guess it's a matter of seeing whether the benefits outweigh the costs, evaluating the trade-offs.  For example, I have a friend who designs cars for a major automobile company.  He loves that part of his job so much that he is able to live with the long hours and the long drive to and from work.  I guess I want to find something in-between, too.    crossposted to  urlLink Journey Inside My Mind        "

And every community needs volunteers.  How do you find out what's available in the world of volunteering in your city? Go to your main public library, chamber of commerce or any hospital system. You will find a plethora of opportunities, and from a 'building your resume' perspective, volunteer work is work and counts in the experience column. It really doesn't matter that you do it for free.  Everyone has interests aside from the workaday world. How about you? Do you like bowling, bird watching, table tennis or wood carving? In most cities you can obtain a listing of special interest groups at your public library.  Understand that networking is universal. Just because someone knows nothing about what you do for a living doesn't mean he or she can't lead you to others who do. Just be prepared to introduce yourself and give a clear, understandable explanation of what you do, or want to do, for a living. Then, show up for meetings and smile. The rest will happen almost automatically.      "

On Monday, Feb. 9, Congressman George Miller and the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) will sponsor a briefing to shed much-needed light on this issue.   Two EPI economists will analyze recent trends in jobs and wages, including the Feb. 6 jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and assess the effectiveness of economic policies to address these trends. Among other things, the economists will discuss the extended duration of the job slump, the slowing of wage growth to less than the rate of inflation, the fall of income for the lowest-paid Americans compared to the rise in income for top earners, the 'missing labor force' excluded from unemployment counts, and the skewing of President Bush's policies toward higher-income tax relief and high federal deficits.  Leading the presentation will be two EPI economists - nationally recognized experts on the economy and employment:   -- Lee Price, EPI research director and former chief economist and Deputy Under Secretary for Economic Affairs at the U.S. Commerce Department  -- Jared Bernstein, EPI senior economist and co-author of the biennial State of Working America  WHAT: Analysis of the recent trends in jobs and wages and the effectiveness of policies to address these trends   WHEN: Monday, Feb. 9, 1:30 p.m.  WHERE: Room 1539, Longworth House Office Building, Washington, D.C.

Don't use your work email account to send resumes from (I know this sounds obvious, but you'd be surprised how many people do this!), and if you must give out a daytime number, use a cell phone or answering service. 3. Posting your resume online can be tricky, if you don't want your current employer to pull you up in a candidate search.  It's much better to not post your resume publicly, and also be careful about sending in resumes to anonymous employers (yes, I've heard of people sending in resumes for their own jobs - it's not pretty!) 4. Track your job search using portable media, like  urlLink Jobfiler , or a notebook you can carry with you.  That way you don't have records on your work computer which indicate you've been searching. 5. Whatever else you do, don't publicly broadcast your job search in a Blog or Discussion Board posts, unless you are fully prepared for the consequences. People have been fired over less.  Good luck with your job search!    "

"2901",2901,449628,"Aries","        Insider Information: Good News! Job Search Expenses Are Deductible in the U.S.   By Harry Collias, H&R Block Tax Specialist  Expenses incurred in the course of searching for a new job can be a deduction against your taxable income.  The Internal Revenue Service has laid down some rules and erected at least one hurdle, but the deduction can make a difference in your final tax bill.  Many job seekers are unaware of this tax benefit; here's how you can take advantage of it.  First, the Rules:  You can deduct certain unreimbursed expenses you incur in looking for a new job, whether or not you are unemployed at the time of the job search, and whether or not you land a new job.  You cannot deduct job search expenses if:  You are looking for a job in a new occupation, or  There has been a substantial break between the ending of your last job and your looking for a new one, or  You are looking for a job for the first time.  If you pass the 'cannot' rules, then you can deduct  Employment and outplacement agency fees.  Costs of typing, printing, and mailing copies of your resume.  Phone and fax expenses, including long distance calls to prospects.  Travel and transportation expenses if you have to travel outside your home territory to look for, or interview for, a job. The trip must be primarily to look for a job. The term 'primarily' refers to the amount of personal activity on the trip compared to the amount of time you spend in looking for work. Even if you cannot justify deduction of travel expenses you can still deduct the expenses of looking for a job while in the area. If you drive you can deduct the standard mileage rate of 36 cents per mile.  Second, the hurdle:  Job search expenses are classified as 'miscellaneous itemized deductions.' This class of deductions (which include union dues, work clothes, and tax prep fees) is only deductible from your income if you itemize deductions and only to the extent that the total exceeds two percent of your adjusted gross income.  Third, some advice:  Keep detailed records of your expenses, in case of audit, and never include expenses for which you have been reimbursed by your prospective employer.

"2914",2914,449628,"Aries","        What Career Choices Do ENFJs Make?   ENFJ is one of the sixteen Myers-Briggs Types.  I'm an ENFJ.  For more information on what this means specifically, you can check out this  urlLink web page .  You could also search it in your favorite search engine; there's a Google search utility on this blog, as a matter of fact.  I belong to an ENFJ email group, and the following message was sent out recently:  I am in between jobs and wanted to know what other people do for a living.  I am also very interested in whether you consider this to be your passion or a career or a just a job.  Thanks.  As I began to read the replies, I thought that it would be useful to post them here.  Here's one:  The basic tread of ENFJs is a quest to teach. Even though I don't teach professionally now, I am always learning stuff so I can teach. I did teach classical piano for 15 years but grew to hate it because while I did have good and exceptional students from time to time, most were just being enriched by their wealthy parents.   Below is a list of my life's work experience. Please do not think of me as a jack of all trades and master of none because that is not true. I just get bored after awhile and want something new. I have been blessed with the ability to change professions, for example, after fifteen years in the auto business becoming the top salesman for Ford in New Jersey, New York and PA, I started taking lessons on the piano and went on to a full time career in music.  1.  Movie Usher. 2.  Construction worker. ( Under my father ) 3.  Heavy machinery driver. ( Florida Turnpike ) 4.  Radar Operator US Army. 5.  Radio Operator US Army. 6.  Supply Seargent US Army. 7.  Auto Salesman. 8.  Auto Parts Department Manager. 9.  Auto Service Department Manager. 10.  Auto Sales Manager. 11.  Piano Teacher. 12.  Piano Tuner. 13.  Pianist. 14.  Accountant. 15.  Real Estate Salesman. 16.  Insurance Salesman. 17.  Computer programmer. 18.  Investigator for State Police. 19.  Stock and Bond Investor  Interesting.  Here's another reply:  I'm so drawn to teaching that after only three years of being a High School teacher I've put my hand up for having a prac teacher from the local uni. So now I teach the kids and help a new teacher learn how to teach.  It's quite an addiction!  High School teaching is a passion, but not necessarily a career. Like [a previous person mentioned] I see myself getting itchy in a few years. I've always fancied going off to Bible College and becoming the pastor of a church. But I'm scared my heart will be too much in it, which would be very dangerous if things went poorly.  Yet another ENFJ replies:  My first thought on this subject was 'career choice?'  I don't feel that I was able to make a career choice.  I kind of fell into my line of work.  I did extremely well in Office Education in high school (but I probably would have done well in other subjects--it was a VERY small school and there were very few programs available outside of the regular curriculum), and when I needed to make money after I graduated I secured an administrative assistant position at the refinery which was our small town's primary employer.  I worked while I went to the local junior college.  Soon I was married and we moved to a slightly larger town so my husband could attend a university.  Of course, the dutiful wife (I score spades in dutiful), the primary income generation fell to me.  An agency got me an interview with a large bank and after working in various departments I was promoted to receptionist in the trust department, where the Sr. VP and trust officer happened to also be an attorney.  My husband, the gypsy, moved us all over and it seemed that one thing led to another, always working for attorneys, because the work was the highest paying clerical work.  (Meanwhile every attempt of mine to go to college was thwarted by said husband...now my ex!)  And I *was* a very good secretary, anticipating the needs of my bosses (and attorneys are VERY needy), well organized, proficient.  But I was a secretary.  I found it extremely demeaning, because I knew I was capable of so much more.  Now, I find myself LOVING my job at a lawfirm--because I am allowed to be SO MUCH MORE!  I am still a legal secretary, but also a legal technologist, handling the technical needs of the firm.  My goal is for the job to work into full time technology, and I think it is a reasonable assumption that it is just a matter of time.  And believe it or not, I like have the secretarial work when I am experiencing information overload and I need to process or just to do something at which I excel.  I have always been appreciated in my jobs, but I have never felt fulfilled until now.    I have been a 'job hopper' because I 'still hadn't found what I was looking for' to coin a U2 lyric!  I, and I suspect others of my type (ENFJ), needed variety and to feel that I added unique value.  Now I get to do many different things, have lots to learn, many challenges, and I have found the right environment (jeans, relaxed atmosphere, great coworkers).  I notice that I am learning not to take things personally, that I no longer expect to win every battle and indeed that some things are not battles anyway.  For instance, I asked for business cards, but the firm does not provide business cards to anyone but attorneys and paralegals.  I will just print my own and eventually I'm sure I will get firm cards, I realize they have never had anyone in this position and are not ready to set this precedent.  I think all of the personal growths I am recognizing are really just due to wisdom, which has come with my advancing years.  I don't make top dollar, but thanks to my husband I don't have to anymore.    I know this is way more than you wanted to know, but I've waxed eloquent on other occasions about how dissatisfied I was with my occupation, and I just wanted to share what a great change has occurred.  I still feel that it resulted because of circumstances (which I attribute to God) and I'm so grateful!  I don't think it is bad, obviously, to keep changing and hunting and striving for the ideal.  (That said, I didn't get a lot of interviews due to my poor tenure!)      "

How did you contact the particular company?  Describe the interviewing process.  Did you work part-time or as a contractor/consultant with the company before being hired?  How long was the process from your first contact with the company to your first day of work?  Describe your emotional state during the process. Were you anxious? Excited? Stressed? Impatient?

First, identify what's holding you back. Do you regularly miss deadlines?  Are you defensive with your manager or argumentative with coworkers? Are you reluctant to take on new tasks?   Once you've admitted to yourself that you need to improve your performance, you have to admit it to your manager. Meet with your boss and share how you want to improve. Ask for feedback on what kind of behavior she'd like to see and ask for her support. Come up with a schedule to check in regularly and discuss your improvement.

"2943",2943,449628,"Aries","        Job Search Tip: Set up automated job search agents   Looking at the lead sources you have targeted for your job search, these sources most likely include job banks, classifieds, recruiters, discussion lists, newsgroups, etc.  Select a number of key sites that you feel would be of assistance, and set up automated job search agents to search for you daily/weekly and email you the results.  This ensures that you are not missing any key job postings, and also gives you an action item first thing every morning (review the jobs that have been emailed to you and respond to the ones that are interesting). Setting up job search agents is a free and easy way to give yourself an edge in your job search. Some of the sites that I recommend looking at and setting up automated agents for include:    urlLink Monster.com      urlLink Career Builder      urlLink  HotJobs.com     Once you have your agents set up, it's merely a matter of staying on top of reviewing and responding to the postings as they come in.  If you are tracking your job search using  urlLink JobFiler or another job search organizer , you can also get a sense for which sites are bringing you the best leads over time, as well as which job sites are posting the same old tired jobs, week after week.

But most of them get no visibility in search engines. Only a few 'A-List' blogs get into the top search engine results for a given topic, while the majority of blogs just don't get noticed. The reason is that the smaller blogs don't have enough links pointing to them. But this posting could solve that. Let's help the smaller blogs get more visibility!  This posting is  urlLink GoMeme 4.0 . It is part of an experiment to see if we can create a blog posting that helps 1000's of blogs get higher rankings in Google. So far we have tried 3 earlier variations. Our first test,  urlLink GoMeme 1.0 , spread to nearly 740 blogs in 2.5 days. This new version 4.0 is shorter, simpler, and fits more easily into your blog.  Why are we doing this? We want to help thousands of blogs get more visibility in Google and other search engines. How does it work? Just follow the instructions below to re-post this meme in your blog and add your URL to the end of the Path List below. As the meme spreads onwards from your blog, so will your URL. Later, when your blog is indexed by search engines, they will see the links pointing to your blog from all the downstream blogs that got this via you, which will cause them to rank your blog higher in search results. Everyone in the Path List below benefits in a similar way as this meme spreads. Try it! Instructions: Just copy this entire post and paste it into your blog.

Chao told the Louisiana Economic Forum that President Bush's leadership and sound economic policies have led to strong job growth in Louisiana and across America, and that the Administration's commitment to reforming training and employment programs will help workers find and prepare for new job opportunities in the growing economy.  'Nationally, this is the 10th straight month of job growth,' Secretary of Labor Elaine L. Chao said in the Forum's keynote address at Southeastern Louisiana University. 'More than 1.5 million new jobs have been created since last August. The national unemployment rate is now 5.6 percent, which is lower than the average unemployment rate of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.'  The steady and consistent growth in the national economy is evident in Louisiana, Secretary Chao noted. Louisiana's unemployment rate has dropped a full percentage point since June of last year. Louisiana added 5,900 jobs in June, across a broad range of sectors. Secretary Chao also pointed out that while the economy continues to improve, the Administration is committed to helping workers who are still looking for good, high-paying jobs.  'These improvements are good news for Louisiana and for the country. But President Bush and this Administration recognize that there are folks in Louisiana who still need help. The Department of Labor has tremendous resources available to help workers who are looking for jobs, transitioning between jobs or upgrading their skills,' Chao said.  Some of the services available to job seekers include job training and counseling. Workers can also receive help paying for transportation, child-care expenses and health insurance premiums while looking for work. Louisiana alone receives $132.8 million annually from the U.S. Department of Labor for training and employment services.  Chao also encouraged workers in need of assistance to visit one of 19 Comprehensive One-Stop Career Centers in Louisiana. Workers can find the nearest center at  urlLink http://www.servicelocator.org .   via  urlLink U.S. Newswire      "

"4799",4799,449628,"Aries","             I've had this list in my email for quite awhile, and it's time I included it here. - DAJ     TWENTY TRUTHS TO LIVE BY   Faith is the ability to not panic. If you worry, you didn't pray. If you pray, don't worry. As a child of God, prayer is kind of like calling home every day. Blessed are the flexible, for they shall not be bent out of shape. When we get tangled up in our problems, be still. God wants us to be still so God can untangle the knot. Do the math. Count your blessings. God wants spiritual fruit, not religious nuts. Dear God: I have a problem. It's me. Silence is often misinterpreted, but never misquoted. Laugh every day. It's like inner jogging. The most important things in your home are the people. Growing old is inevitable. Growing up is optional. There is no key to happiness. The door is always open. A grudge is a heavy thing to carry. He who dies with the most toys is still dead. We do not remember days, but moments. Life moves too fast, so enjoy your precious moments. Nothing is real to you until you experience it; otherwise it's just hearsay. It's all right to sit on your pity pot every now and again. Just flush when you are done. Living your life successfully and surviving requires courage. The goals and dreams you're seeking require courage and risk taking. Learn from the turtle -- it only makes progress when it sticks out its neck. Be more concerned with your character than your reputation, because your character is what you really are, while your reputation is merely what others think you are.          "

"4881",4881,449628,"Aries","              Justifiable Use of Force   Today is Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birthday.  As many know, he was a civil rights activist that worked for peace through nonviolent means.  Are there any times when violence is right?  What a difficult question to answer.  Ever since the terrorist attacks on the US last year, I have believed that it is necessary to use force.  We gave the Taliban time to turn over Osama bin Laden, and they let it run out.  As a result, we dropped bombs on them.  On a much smaller scale, I think about times when my wife and I must discipline our daughter.  We have set up boundaries and expectations for her.  When she goes outside of those boundaries, we have a moral obligation to discipline her, so that she can learn to respect authority.  Sometimes, then, we need to spank her.  Other times we remove priveleges.  I believe that the United States and its allies have taken a similar approach in the war on terrorism.  Basically, President Bush has stated that terrorists will be disciplined for their acts of terror.  Financial assets have been frozen.  Also, we've used military force.  Thus, I see our current situation as one in which the use of force is justified.  The principle is the same in law enforcement.  A police officer tells a gun-wielding suspect to drop his or her weapon.  If he or she does not, then in some cases, the officer may have to use deadly force.   What do you think?

Media-watchers were startled when a racy commercial for Zahn's show, 'American Morning with Paula Zahn,' ran on CNN over the weekend.   'Where can you find a morning news anchor who's provocative, super-smart, oh, yeah, and just a little sexy?' a male announcer asked during the 20-second spot. The word 'sexy' flashed in red letters and an image of the well-coiffed blond anchor popped up on screen.   The ad was pulled yesterday morning.

The dream seemed like it lasted about an hour, as though it could have been an episode of a TV drama.  As these things often are, unfortunately the details are now fuzzy.  Below are some things that I can remember, though:  - The chase mostly occurred on the elevators - We knew that a friend of ours, TM, was on his way into work.  He had parked on the 9-1/2th floor.  We tried for as long as possible to keep the elevator from stopping there because we knew that TM was unaware of the danger before him. - To make the elevator stop at the 9-1/2 floor, you had to press the buttons for the 9th and 10th floors and stop the elevator in between.  I remember something like this being done in the movie ' urlLink Being John Malchovich '. - Just as soon as we thought things were getting back to normal, this guy - the psychopath - would flip out again and resume chasing us. - Indeed we felt like we were almost always on the run for our lives. - Eventually we thought it was safe enough to get TM from the 9-1/2th floor, but as soon as we stopped there, we realized that the psycho has become aware of the existence of the 9-1/2 floor.  We had somehow thought that it was a 'safe haven' - until then. - Unfortunately we couldn't help our friend TM.  By the time we arrived at the 9-1/2th floor, the psychopath had already got to him.         "

"4916",4916,449628,"Aries","              Like Peeing on the Floor    This may sound like a strange title, but you'll get what I mean as you read on.   We came home tonight from a meeting with MM and KM, two close friends of ours, to talk about our marriage.  I thought things were going Ok, but Jennie didn't think so.  So we discussed how she was feeling and why she was feeling that way.  It turns out that I haven't been as considerate of her as I should be.  In the Bible, Philippians 2:3-4 urlLink   mentions that we should think of one another as better than ourselves.  I haven't been doing that, and I've realized that I'm hurting Jennie when I'm being this way.  She doesn't feel loved, for example, when I spend more time at work than need be, or more time on the computer, instead of with her.  It's not that she wants to hog all my time; she just needs to feel loved.  She needs me, with my full attention.  We also discussed how Jennie ought to change, from my perspective.  This question was very hard for me to answer at first.  I started getting very emotional, to the point where I was crying.  I don't know exactly where it came from - all of a sudden I was sobbing in their living room.  I felt incredibly embarassed, as though I had lost control of my bladder and was peeing on their floor.  I felt guilty for once again hearing how much I've hurt my wife by my actions.  I really hate myself when I do that.  Feeling so bad about it, I guess, led to the guilt, which led to the depressive episode, which included the crying.  It was another of those times when I struggled to find good in the situation.  Boy, when this depression hits, it hits hard.  One thing I am definitely grateful for in our marriage is that our love is there, yet there are still times when I need to be affirmed.  You know what I mean?  I know women feel the same way - we need to hear that we're loved and appreciated.  I guess that I haven't been feeling that from Jennie lately.  And she hasn't felt loved because I've let other things occupy my time instead of her.  So we both have things to work on - which is why we wake up in the morning - because God isn't finished with us yet.  Oh yeah, the great thing about true friends is that they love you even when you behave like a child who's peeing on the floor.  So long and good night, everyone.         "

What he failed to mention is the fact that booze, as a universal solvent, immediately liquefies all the cells and synapses in those areas of the brain having to do with judgment, coordination, and common sense; turns them to mush.  Afterward, its like trying to cogitate with a cranium full of Cream of Wheat.  Here are three quickies to illustrate my point:  --  A n airman with a BAC (blood alcohol content) of 0.22 decided it would be the coolest thing ever if he jumped onto the back bumper of a departing Honda delete Sol to see how long he could hang on to the trunk lid as it sped away.  Got to give the kid credit for tenacity.  He stayed with it till 50 miles an hour, when his fingernails failed structurally, at which time, parasitic drag dumped him onto the highway.    --  A  pickup truckload of our Coast Guard brethren left a bar and headed down the road with four drunks in the cab and two more drunks passed out in the bed.  (Yes, as it turns out, our friends in the funny hats are human, too.)       After they dropped their first shipmate off at home, they regained the interstate and were headed for the second guys house at about 55 miles an hour when, like a scene from Night of the Living Dead, one of the corpses in the back stood up, wobbled slightly, stepped stiffly over the tailgate and disappeared into the glare of headlights from oncoming traffic.        Suddenly everybodys sober.  They screech to a halt.  Doors fly open.  Everyone bails out and races back along the interstate in a frantic search for their buddy.  But they cant find him.        Wait!  There he is!  Face down in the middle of the interstate  backlit by the headlights of a car that has him bore-sighted!        Time compression kicks in as they all wave their arms in slow motion and scream (in an extremely low register), 'NOOOOOOO!' Trying, to no avail, to ward off the inevitable.  Thump-Thump.  And the car sped off into the night  didnt even slow down.        But you know what?  The guy lived!  I mean he was messed up big time, but he lived, which means, in the face of this new evidence, that I must retract my previous statement.  Them Coasties aint human after all.     --  A s soon as a drunken Marine ditched his liberty buddies and headed back to the base, he spied a restaurant and thought hes stop in for a bite to eat.  The fact that the restaurant was closed didnt slow the sergeant down a whit.  This Marine wanted chow and no bars, no locked doors, and no alarm systems were going to stand in his way.        Perhaps it was the cold food or maybe it was the slow service, but something must have really irritated this guy because after hed been in there a while he began to tear the place up.        It wasnt long before the gendarmes, summoned by burglar alarm, arrived and tried some of their high-powered psychology to coax the Marine outside.  But, he (totally impervious to logic) wasnt having any of that and told the copy to take their best shot.        Well, in this case, the cops best shot happened to be a ninety-pound German Shepherd, and they told the hungry Marine that if he didnt come out, they were sending Bruno in.        'Bring him on!'  says the Marine.  And so Chief Wiggims let slip the dog of war.        BA DA BING!  The dog is on the Marine like white on rice and showing absolutely no respect for the sergeant.  Actually, Brunos finding the sergeant to be a rather zesty morsel (kinda like a slider at Mid-rats), and the fact that the Marine decided to fight back only served to whet the dogs already prodigious appetite all the more.         In the end, of course, the score was Drunken-Devil Dog - zero, Regular Dog - five.  (Five being the total number of useless fingers dangling at the end of the sergeants right arm that  ever since that night  have refused to respond to his commands.)         B .  I always get burn severity messed up.  Cant remember if its third degree or first degree that leaves you looking like a burger that fell off the grille and lay unnoticed on the coals for a spell.        I will say this, however.  I got this second degree burn stuff down pat, especially after I dumped boiling water and equally boiling coffee grounds on my hand one morning recently while trying to brew a cup of java while I was still asleep.        But that was small change compared to what a drunken seaman did not long ago.  It seems that six beers and a couple shots of bourbon convinced this guy he was an acrobat.  After ditching his buddies at the bar, our here made it back to the pier Ok.  But there, the lure of fame and the challenge of the high wire were more than he could resist.  So, instead of plodding drunkenly along on something stable and flat link the concrete roadway, this would=be Flying Wallenda jumped up on the CHT piping that ran parallel with the pier and began tippy-toeing along its length toward his ship.  And he was lookin gooooood, beloved.  Until, that it, he encountered a knot of pumps and valves that squirts a solution of highly caustic hypochlorite into the raw sewage.  There, he stumbled and fell.        But, true to his calling, he wasnt going down without a fight.  He frantically grabbed for a handhold  anything to break his fall, and he snagged one!  Unfortunately, what he snagged was one of those high pressure chemical lines which immediately popped out of its fitting and sprayed our hapless hero from head to toe with a caustic bath of searing hypo-chloride.        At the hospital they catalogued his misery as: second degree chemical burns of the groin, the abdomen, left thigh, right ear, left face and left arm.  And, for good measure, a third degree burn on his inner right thigh that nearly fried his oysters and will require several skin grafts.        But I did get a chuckle out of the unbridled optimism of this report, which said that, after five days in the hospital and 35 days out of work, No permanent disability is anticipated.'  Yeah, right.        I burned my hand two months ago and its still as pink as sunrise except when it turns purplish red in the shower and throbs like mad if I get it in warm water.  Dont let anybody fool you; this guys going to be in pain for a long, long time.         C .  I read in the paper this week that Daimler-Chrysler has embarked on a program designed to provide job security for the entire traffic safety section of the naval safety center for a good many years to come.  With the rollout of their new Dodge, V-10, pick-up truck, we enter a new era of potential disaster.  When one considers that sailors in the past have actually managed to break telephone poles in half using just a motorcycle, the possibilities for carnage, mayhem, death and destruction posed by this new, 150-mile-an-hour, 4000 pound, unguided rocket in the hands of your average North American blue jacket are enough to boggle the mind.        Heaven knows theyre doing a more than adequate job with the tools at hand today:         A  carload of sailors were on their way to a little weekend liberty, when the kid in the right seat spilled a drink in his lap and then turned and started ragging the driver about his erratic motoring skills.  The driver barked back.  So, in response, the passenger dumped what was left in his cup on the drivers leg you know, just to give him a feel for what its like to be facing a night on the town looking like youve recently lost control of your bladder.  This brought a heated retort from the driver, who totally failed to see the humor.  At which time the passenger doubled up his fist and smashed it into the windshield (Take that!), and the driver responded by slamming on the brakes and skidding headfirst into a mini-van in the opposing lane of traffic.         A t a party Saturday night I met a woman who teaches anger management to elementary school children.  I found that highly amusing until she explained to me there is real value in early training for the still undeveloped infantile mind in the techniques for handling stress and managing anger.  Maybe Ill give her these guys address to see if she can hook them up with some kind of correspondence course.  It couldnt hurt.  --- end of post ----         "
"4920",4920,449628,"Aries","             I am feeling very emotional.  I just spent time praying to God about how I'm feeling.  Crying, angry, bitter, frustrated.  Hot tears falling from my eyes.  Hurting from within my heart, wanting it all to go away.  Even more troublesome was that I was doing this in front of my little girl.  She had been 'scared', and both Jennie and I were tired, wanting to go to bed.  She kept crying out for one of us.  When she cried out to me, I was so upset.  I went in with my voice raised telling her she needed to go to sleep.  I asked if she wanted to pray, and she said yes.  Well, I started praying for her, and then I started crying out my frustration with how I've been feeling.  I often have a hard time with this depression and ADHD stuff I'm dealing with.  I have trouble seeing what I can control and what I cannot.  I'm upset that I'm hurting those whom I love the most - Jennie and Keisha.  I've not been responsible.  I feel like I've let so many people down, especially Jennie.    Because of this I feel so guilty.  Why do I keep putting her and Keisha through these times?  This is not who I was when we got married.  Our relationship was so much different then than it is now.  It seems so much harder now.  The feelings aren't always there, but my commitment is.  I don't understand why I'm feeling this way.  I wish I could be happy and not mess up the world around me.  I want this all to go away.         "

Even now, I don't feel like giving my heart to others because I'm not feeling 100% healthy.  We can be so easily distracted by the worries of life, etc.  We all need to do our part in taking care of ourselves and each other.  In addition, we need to keep praying to God.  Write letters in a journal (this online weblog is a great venue).  Write poems, love letters to Jesus.  We all need to grow deeper in our love for him.  For help, I often go back to the  urlLink Psalms , for example.  In addition, the Bible states in Hebrews 10:25-27 that we need to consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds.  I believe this is possible.  I also believe that God has given all of us gifts to be used to serve him.  I am trying to think of my mental illness as a gift from God.  I'm not always good at doing that, but I'm trying.  The apostle Paul wrote that  urlLink God uses our weaknesses to demonstrate his power , so, Amen, then, show your power, O Lord!

Well, I don't like it quite as much as this woman apparently did:  Kimberly Herricks, 36, a manager for Donato's Pizza, Lakewood, Ohio, was indicted in December for stealing $38,000 from the company, an amount that included the value of 400 decaying pizzas found in her garage. According to police, she had invented big call-in orders at her store for schools, hospitals, etc., just to get her store's sales figures up and her name in the company newsletter. She would then adjust the books to cover the costs and deliver the pizzas, herself, to her own garage. She was busted when she asked her boss (the owner) to help her move to a new house, and he discovered the rotting pizzas.

"4926",4926,449628,"Aries","              A Recap During a Nightcap   Greetings, crimestoppers!  Time for a brief recap of my day (Saturday).  Started off by going to bed at 4:10 AM after watching the movies ' urlLink Bounce ' and ' urlLink Hannibal ' (quite a combination, huh?).  Naturally, it took a little while to fall asleep, having the ending of 'Hannibal' still in my mind (pun not intended).  Keisha came in at about 8:30 AM as Jennie was heading to the library to return some videos ('Yes, get that 'Hannibal' film out of here!!!!').  At about 10:39 Keisha convinced me to get out of bed.  So I got up for a few seconds and then lay back down.  Finally, around 10:45 I get up for good.  Since it was late morning, we wondered if we still could have breakfast.  Keisha and I thought about that for a little bit, and then we were distracted by the nice weather outside.  Jennie came home shortly after noon, so we decided to get out of the house and get something to eat.  But we wanted some time to read our Bibles without Keisha distracting us, so we decided to go to a place that has a play area for kids - the  urlLink Burger King  in  urlLink Beavercreek, Ohio , near the  urlLink Mall at Fairfield Commons .  Silly us.  We chose the busiest place in the area.  Fortunately for me, I had some headphones as I typed into my laptop, but Jennie, I could tell, was very distracted..  About 2 PM we left an went to the  urlLink Deaf Association of Dayton on Valley Street  to hang out there for a few hours.  There we met Tom and Elizabeth from  urlLink Kettering .  Tom was born deaf, and his wife Elizabeth is a substitute teacher at  urlLink St. Rita's School for the Deaf  in Woodlawn, Ohio.  It was great learning new signs, etc.  I could tell Jennie and Keisha had fun, too.  Then we came home.  I was eager for a nap by now, but Jennie encouraged me that we should go through our mail.  We hadn't gone through it together in awhile.  Perhaps more on that another time.  Needless to say, I did the right thing and did    not    take a nap.  After working through the mail for awhile, we decided we needed a break.  So we went to  urlLink Meijer in Englewood .  We really only needed a few items, but somehow we spent a lot of time there.  It may have had something to do with Keisha and I getting split up from Jennie and those three laps around the grocery section we took looking for her.  It may have also been due to our browsing videos, pets, toys, and more.  Nevertheless, by about 9 PM, we all were pretty bushed.  So we came home put Keisha to bed after feeding her some leftover  urlLink Pizza Hut stuffed crust pizza .  Then Jennie cooked a frozen pizza we bought, and we ate it while watching the movie ' urlLink Rattle and Hum ' by  urlLink U2 .  Funny.  It's almost 1 AM on Sunday morning and I'm still going.  Well, not exactly.  My eyes are barely open. Even funnier are all the references to places in this entry for which I could create hyperlinks.  Perhaps later.  I'm heading for the sack.

I can see problems from a global scale and get completely overwhelmed and avoid them.  At other times I get bogged down unnecessarily on details.  We discussed breaking tasks down into small, manageable pieces - pieces that I can handle and commit to doing for a short period of time.  Kinda like eating an elephant.  Eating the whole elephant is an overwhelming task when considered from a global perspective.  But, when the task is broken down into subtasks, the task is not as overwhelming.  I know this, but I haven't applied this to my life that well.  So now I start.         "
"4933",4933,449628,"Aries","              Tooth Extraction   I was talking with a coworker this morning who is considering having his wisdom teeth taken out.  We've told him about our experiences, and he's a little apprehensive, not wanting it to be a horror story himself.  I got all four of my wisdom teeth taken out at once.  Before going to the oral surgeon's office, I ate some hot and spicy buffalo wings, since I knew that I wouldn't be able to eat them for awhile.  I didn't have insurance coverage (college boy supporting self fortunately had $ from co-op job and student loans), so I had to pay out of pocket.  Fortunately, I had waited until all four of them had erupted.  All the surgeon had to do was extract them; no cutting necessary.  Only local anesthesia (novocaine?) on the jaw.  So there I was.  Wide awake, yet feeling no pain... for now.  The surgeon pulled three of them out.  The last one was harder.  I remember him yanking my jaw back and forth ('Gee, you're really making me   work   for this one!' said the man getting paid over $100 per tooth.).  That hurt a little.  After it was all finished, I contacted my roommates, who picked me up.  Eager to get home, I climbed in the back seat.  Jorge, one of my roommates, wanted to check on his job application at University Hospital, so we stopped there.  What was meant to be a very quick wait wound up lasting over a half hour.  By this time I was hurting big time, and    very    eager to get home and rest.  So when that time finally arrived, I went upstairs and lay down in bed.  Some time later the phone rang.  It was Lindsey Nelson, a friend from church who was in Medical School at UC (i.e., University of Cincinnati).  'What's up?' he asked.  'I'm in pain.  I just had my wisdom teeth taken out.' I muffled with my mouth full of cotton.  'Would you like a shake?' he asked. 'Sure.' I replied.  I hung up and went back to sleep.  Sometime later Lindsey shows up with a 32-oz homemade chocolate shake.  Now,   that   was encouraging!         "

"4945",4945,449628,"Aries","              Emergency Room   Yesterday our family made a trip to the emergency room.  It turned out to be a long wait for inconclusive results.  Sunday night Jennie was having abdominal and back pain, which kept her from going to sleep.  At about 1:30 AM we drove to the hospital.  Jennie was admitted at 1:40 AM.  About an hour and a half later Keisha and I were asked to go to her room.  We waited.  And tried to keep Keisha from getting into everything.  Keisha had a rough time waking up, but after about an hour, she was wide awake, as though it was daytime.  So there Jennie and I were, extremely tired, trying to keep Keisha from getting into everything in the examining room.  With the pillow Keisha brought I lay down on the floor and tried to doze off. How crazy.  No chance of getting to sleep there.  Why the long wait, we wondered.  I went to the nurses' station and asked what was taking so long.  I found out that they needed to do some tests on Jennie to try to uncover what was wrong.  I asked Jennie if she would mind if Keisha and I went out to get a bite to eat.  She said she didn't mind.  So Keisha and I got into the car, trying to dodge the freezing rain, and we drove to the ATM and then to White Castle, the closest 24-hour restaurant.  Of course they didn't have the Cinnamon rolls we wanted, so we opted for the Cheese danish and Apple danish.  We drove back to the hospital parking lot and ate our food, and then we went back inside the ER.  Nothing had changed; Jennie was still waiting, but fortunately, she had gotten a little bit of sleep.  I asked Jennie if she would mind if Keisha and I went back to the car and napped.  She said she didn't.  I told her that the hospital folks could call us on the cell phone if they needed.  So Keisha and I went back to the car and fell asleep.  At about 5:30 AM Jennie came out, having been discharged and with a prescription in hand.  It all seemed like a waste of time, to have waited so long for something that might as well been taken care of at the doctor's office.  But, I guess it's better to be safe.  Jennie and I were suprised that Keisha still wanted to go to school, having had intermittent sleep during the night.  But she insisted.  I, on the other hand, chose to stay home and take care of Jennie.  This came in handy when I go a phone call to go pick up a friend who had just had outpatient surgery.  I was able to let Jennie sleep while I picked our friend up.  I also was able to see Keisha off the school bus when it was time for her to come home.  In between these times, I got some more sleep.  In fact, at about 2:30 PM, I told Jennie I was going to take a nap.  I woke up at 8 PM.  It was indeed a crazy day.          "

No, not the annual kind to celebrate when I've added another year to my life.  More like a rebirth of sorts.  It was forced on me somewhat.  I had not been spending my time wisely while at work, and it was showing.  I would make excuses for why progress wasn't where it should be, but really I was just horsing around, not getting the work done.  I've had an improper work ethic.  Today it came to a head when I was given a sharp rebuke from two of my team members.  The other one was out today, but he probably could have chimed in just as much.  I was presented with an ultimatum, so to speak.  Needless to say, that got my attention.  So, I begin anew, with an improved work ethic.  I am also needing to be aware of what's going on around me.  Even if others aren't seeing what I'm doing, I know that God sees, and his opinion is what ultimately matters.  The true sign of a person's integrity is who they are when no one else is around.  I haven't been a man of integrity, that's for sure.  But I can and will keep changing.  I really want to do it for God, but I know I'll be tempted to do it to please men.

"4955",4955,449628,"Aries","              Drink Water (or Eight Things to Do with Coca Cola)   This item was sent to me by MJ over a year ago.  I cannot verify whether the information here is valid or not.   Interesting facts: Water vs. Coca Cola   * 75% of Americans are chronically dehydrated. (Likely applies to half world pop.) In 37% of Americans, the thirst mechanism is so weak that it is often mistaken for hunger.  * Even MILD dehydration will slow down one's metabolism as much as 3%.  * One glass of water shuts down midnight hunger pangs for almost 100% of the dieters studied in a U-Washington study.  * Lack of water: the #1 trigger of daytime fatigue.  * Preliminary research indicates that 8-10 glasses of water a day could significantly ease back and joint pain for up to 80% of sufferers.  * A mere 2% drop in body water can trigger fuzzy short-term memory, trouble with basic math, and difficulty focusing on the computer screen or on a printed page.  * Drinking 5 glasses of water daily decreases the risk of colon cancer by 45%, plus it can slash the risk of breast cancer by 79%, and one is 50% less likely to develop ladder cancer.  Are you drinking the amount of water you should every day?   COKE: No wonder it tastes soooo good:   1. In many states (in the USA) the highway patrol carries two gallons of Coke in the trunk to remove blood from the highway after a car accident.  2. You can put a T-bone steak in a bowl of coke and it will be gone in two days.  3. To clean a toilet: Pour a can of Coca-Cola into the toilet bowl and ... Let the 'real thing' sit for one hour, then flush clean. The citric acid in Coke removes stains from vitreous china.  4. To remove rust spots from chrome car bumpers: Rub the bumper with a crumpled-up piece of Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil dipped in Coca-Cola.  5. To clean corrosion from car battery terminals. Pour a can of Coca-Cola over the terminals to bubble away the corrosion.  6. To loosen a rusted bolt: Applying a cloth soaked in Coca-Cola to the rusted bolt for several minutes.  7. To bake a moist ham: Empty a can of Coca-Cola into the baking pan, wrap the ham in aluminum foil, and bake. Thirty minutes before the ham is finished, remove the foil, allowing the drippings to mix with the Coke for a sumptuous brown gravy.  8. To remove grease from clothes: Empty a can of coke into a load of greasy clothes, add detergent, and run through a regular cycle. The Coca-Cola will help loosen grease stains. It will also clean road haze from your windshield.   FYI: -   1. The active ingredient in Coke is phosphoric acid. Its pH is 2.8. It will dissolve a nail in about 4 days.  2. To carry Coca-Cola syrup (the concentrate) the commercial truck must use the Hazardous material place cards reserved for Highly corrosive materials.  3. The distributors of Coke have been using it to clean the engines of their trucks for about 20 years.  Still Want To Drink Up?   Update, 27 March 2003:   I've been doing some research on  urlLink Snopes.com , and I found this out -- The claim that the acids in Coca-Cola not only make it a handy household cleaning product, but harmful to drink as well are   false  .

Then the man came out with tears in his eyes.  'I tried, but I can't kill my wife.'  The agent said, 'You don't have what it takes.  Take your wife and go home.'  Finally, it was the woman's turn.  She was given the same instructions to kill her husband. She took the gun and went into the room.  Shots were heard, one shot after another.  They heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. After a few minutes, all was quiet. The door opened slowly and there stood the woman.  She wiped the sweat from her brow, and said, 'This gun is loaded with blanks. I had to beat him to death with the chair.'          "

I was bare-chested.  I felt self-conscious, but since I was running a little late, I couldn't go back home to get a shirt.  I saw some guys playing basketball and went over to one of them.  He suggested I ask one of the guys who was playing if he had an extra shirt.  I did.  Then... almost immediately... the scene changed (and so does the tense).  I'm in this meeting facility and have just heard that the President of the United States is on his way to give a speech at this particular facility.  I am excited.  After some time, I hear a helicopter.  I run to the front window and notice some Secret Service men walking toward the building.  I also see some important dignitaries getting off the helicopter.  A receiving line begins to form outside in front of the entrance, and I join it.  After a little while, the President steps out of the helicopter.  But wait a minute!  No, it's not George W. Bush, the  current  US President.  It's Ronald Reagan, looking in great health, too!  He proceeds toward the receiving line and greets everyone.  He even shakes my hand!

His face was in pain, yet still itching badly.  So he kept scratching.  Eventually he passed out.  Some hours later he awoke.  His face felt sore, but it was no longer itching.  He examined his hands; they were bloody.  He stood up and went to the mirror.  His face looked terrible.  There were multiple gashes on his face.  He went to the bathroom and washed his hands and face.  It looked as though he had lost a fight with a cat.  How was he going to explain this to everyone?  Would they consider him weird?

I climbed into the wheelchair and put the basket to hold my groceries down and started off.  Honestly, it felt a little weird.  It was so different, going around the store in the wheelchair.  For one thing, I had to use my arms to move the wheels.  It was also a bit strange as I interacted with other people, especially when they or I had to move out of the way to get where we were going.  I was very tempted to ask for sympathy, but I didn't, thankfully.  When I finally paid for my groceries, I wheeled myself out of the store, into the parking lot, and up to my car.  Then I got out of the wheelchair and walked it to where the other shopping carts were.  I was glad for the experience because I can better empathize with others who use wheelchairs.         "

"4969",4969,449628,"Aries","              Understanding Written Communication    I was inspired to write this as a result of a conversation Jennie and I had with our friend DB.  She received something in an email from another friend of ours, and what it contained seemed to disturb her.   Written communication can be difficult to understand.  Since I read words that have already been spoken, I only have that evidence to go on in order to understand the writer's message.  More exists than simply the written text.  As a reader, I must consider the following:    What is the main theme? What are the main points? What is the writer's tone? What can I get from the author's choice of words? What about the writer's style? What bias do I bring as I read? What is the mood of the piece? What mood do I bring as I read? If I know the writer, how is my relationship with him/her?    I propose that with what an author writes, he or she has put forth a challenge to potential readers:   Understand what I'm writing.    While some may consider that idea obvious, I believe it is important to examine more than simply the text an author has given us.  To truly understand an author's message, therefore, we must take an active role as we read.         "

"5015",5015,449628,"Aries","              Words Women Use    I appreciate this much needed advice from a woman for men on how to communicate with women.  I've heard it said that communication across both hemispheres for a woman is like a superhighway, whereas for us men it's more like a dirt path.  As a result, we need all the help we can get!    FINE:  This is the word we use at the end of any argument that we feel we are right about but need to shut you up. NEVER use 'Fine' to describe how a woman looks. This will cause you to have one of those arguments.   FIVE MINUTES:  This is half an hour. It is equivalent to the five minutes that your football game is going to last before you take out the trash, so it's an even trade.   NOTHING:  This means something and you should be on your toes. 'Nothing' is usually used to describe the feeling a woman has of wanting to turn you inside out, upside down, and backwards. 'Nothing' usually signifies an argument that will last 'Five Minutes' and end with the word 'Fine'.   GO AHEAD (with raised eyebrows):  This is a dare.  One that will result in a woman getting upset over 'Nothing' and will end with the word 'Fine'.   GO AHEAD (normal eyebrows):  This means 'I give up' or 'do what you want because I don't care'. You will get a raised eyebrow 'Go Ahead' in just a few minutes, followed by 'Nothing' and 'Fine' and she will talk to you in about 'Five Minutes' when she cools off.   LOUD SIGH:  This is not actually a word, but is still often a verbal statement very misunderstood by men. A 'Loud Sigh' means she thinks you are an idiot at that moment and wonders why she is wasting her time standing here and arguing with you over 'Nothing'.   SOFT SIGH:  Again, not a word, but a verbal statement.  'Soft Sighs' are one of the few things that some men actually understand. She is content. Your best bet is to not move or breathe and she will stay content.   THAT'S OKAY:  This is one of the most dangerous statements that a woman can say to a man. 'That's Okay' means that she wants to think long and hard before paying you retributions for whatever it is that you have done. 'That's Okay' is often used with the word 'Fine' and used in conjunction with a raised eyebrow 'Go Ahead'. At some point in the near future when she has plotted and planned, you are going to be in some mighty big trouble.   PLEASE DO:  This is not a statement, it is an offer.  A woman is giving you the chance to come up with whatever excuse or reason you have for doing whatever it is that you have done. You have a fair chance to tell the truth, so be careful and you shouldn't get a 'That's Okay'.   THANKS:  A woman is thanking you. Do not faint,  just say 'You're Welcome.'   THANKS A LOT:  This is much different from 'Thanks'.  A woman will say, 'Thanks A Lot' when she is really ticked off at you. It signifies that you have hurt her in some callous way, and will be followed by the 'Loud Sigh'. Be careful not to ask what is wrong after the 'Loud Sigh', as she will only tell you 'Nothing'.         "

I am unsure when the weblog was begun, since I cannot yet access the archives.   I would venture to say that this blog was created recently.  On this very personal site we learn a lot about her, since she has revealed a lot of detail about herself. For example, we get to read things happening in her life when she was 3-1/2, 10, and 16.  From this information and other posts, we learn that Maggie is 18-19 years old and attending college somewhere in Virginia.  And then, theres her favorites lists, where she lists items she has brand loyalty, people who are on her bad side (only three), TV shows, music, and so on.  She is not afraid to share how shes really feeling, whether its about her roommate or spring break or her family.  Maggie appears to enjoy her online presence very much, as evidenced by the link to her Harry Potter fanfic and her passion for listening to remixes of video game music.  I have oftern wondered myself what the dance mix of the theme to 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?' would sound like.   This blog would be somewhere I would like to return to in awhile, once the layout and navigation is completed. It appears that she plans to add more links and a webcam sometime in the future.  I did follow some of the links that were included, however.  I especially like the link to the 'What Muppet Am I?' quiz (I'm Fozzie, by the way.).

He did, however, have his own form of air conditioning.  Some folks did not like it, unfortunately.  His method was called breaking wind.  It wouldn't usually be a problem when he was alone, but he always noticed the angry faces around him when he used his personal air conditionaing in a crowded elevator.  To his dismay, that is where he and several others were stuck.  In a crowded elevator between the 7th and 8th floors.  The air was getting rather sticky, and, just as sweating is involuntary, so was his personal air conditioner.  He was glad, for the others' sake, that his air conditioner didn't go off very often.  You see, his built-in system provided him with adequate cooling, but it was not continuous, as sweating is.  A couple hours later, he finally let go, having let the pressure build up until the proper time.  A loud sound, and then, screams of people gasping for air, could be heard in the elevator shaft.

"5054",5054,449628,"Aries","              The Winner?    Thanks to my old high school classmate LH for this email.   An old native American Grandfather said to his grandson, who came to him with anger toward a friend who had done him an injustice: 'Let me tell you a story. I too, at times, have felt a great hate for those that have taken so much, with no sorrow for what they have done. But hate wears you down, and does not hurt your enemy. It is like taking poison and wishing your enemy would die. I have struggled with these feelings many times.'  He continued, 'It is as if there are two wolves inside me; one is good and does no harm. He lives in harmony with all around him and does not take offense when no offense was intended. He will only fight when it is right to do so, and in the right way. He saves all his energy for the right fights.  But the other wolf, ah! He is full of anger. The littlest thing will set him into a fit of temper. He fights everyone, all the time, for no reason. He cannot think because his anger and hate are so great. It is helpless anger, for his anger will change nothing.  Sometimes it is hard to live with these two wolves inside me, for both of them try to dominate my spirit.'  The boy looked intently into his Grandfather's eyes and asked, 'Which one wins, Grandfather?'  The Grandfather smiled and quietly said, 'The one I feed.'  -- Native American Author Unknown         "

I do not consider myself to be an expert on marriage - I've only been married for 7 years - but since I do have a little bit of experience, I'll share what I believe.  First of all, my wife and I are committed followers of Jesus Christ.  We consider our individual relationships with God as paramount to any other relationship.  Secondly, our relationship with each other is more important than family, friends, etc.  Since our wedding day, we both have taken our vows seriously.  The gushy emotions we felt during the first year of marriage have not persisted.  It is the love we each have for God and for each other that has kept us together.    9 Two are better than one,  because they have a good return for their work:  10 If one falls down,  his friend can help him up.  But pity the man who falls  and has no one to help him up!  11 Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm.  But how can one keep warm alone?  12 Though one may be overpowered,  two can defend themselves.  A cord of three strands is not quickly broken.   -- Ecclesiastes 4:9-12 (NIV)    Here is another way to look at it:  God, my wife, and I are at each corner of a triangle.  He does not move.  As Jennie (my wife's name) and I move closer to God, we get closer to each other by default.  So the key to having a healthy marriage is for each person to stay close to God.  This relates to the subject of infidelity.  Early in our marriage I used to believe that I wouldn't struggle with lust.  After all, I'm married now!  I was naive.  As I mentioned before, the gushy feelings we had have not always been there, but our commitment to each other has.  I have found that when I am not close to God, I tend to be open toward stuggles with lust.  Remember the triangle: If we move away from God, we also move away from each other.  Keeping a healthy marriage is hard work!  One should not think it any other way.  It involves daily renewing our vows.  It also involves a lot of grace and forgiveness - from God and from each other.  Having other spiritually mature couples in our lives has also been important.  But most important of all, is our commitment to God.  If you are interested in learning more about getting a better relationship with God, I can help.  Feel free to contact me and leave a way that I can reply.         "

"5124",5124,449628,"Aries","              Dog Days of Summer - Already    Disclaimer:  Please do not read this if you have a delicate stomach or are eating or have just eaten.   Two weeks ago we got a four-month old puppy.  He's part Chocolate Lab and part Collie.  We are struggling with killing this dog - over housebreaking.  OK, I'm not serious about killing the dog - I'd never do that.  But I am letting it upset me.  We also bought a cage, in which he sleeps.  The idea behind having Jake (the dog's name) sleep in the cage is based upon the dog's natural instinct not to relieve himself where he sleeps.  We also put him in the cage whenever we go out of the house to go grocery shopping or whatever.  Yet when we're at home, we let him out and take him outside to relieve himself.  When he's inside, we need to make sure that he isn't unsupervised.  He's been known to pee and poop from time to time.  Case in point:  Not even 10 minutes ago, we had just finished dinner, and I'm sitting here typing at the computer when I smell dog poop.  I noticed that Jake had somehow gotten downstairs.  I sent him back upstairs and looked around to see where the dog had been, and, sure enough, he left a  poop pile  on the carpet!  I ran upstairs to get the pooper scooper and came back downstairs.  As I approached to poop, the smell got to me.  I felt it coming.  So I ran to the garbage can and  threw up .  Tasha, the deaf woman who, with her 10 month old son, lives in this area of the house, took the pooper scooper and went to pick it up.  Then  she  started gagging.  I knew what was coming for her, and of course, that prompted the gag reflex in me.  So I ran to the stationary tub and  threw up two more times .  Then Tasha came running to the downstairs bathroom, which is located next to the stationary tubs, and  vomited .  Hearing her vomiting again prompted the gag reflex in me again, and I  threw up two more times .  Keisha, our four-year old daughter, just attempted to come downstairs.  I told her to stay upstairs.  She isn't wearing her hearing aids, so she said, 'What?' and I heard her begin the descent.  'Stay upstairs, Keisha!'  Then I yelled, just to make sure she heard me, 'STAY UPSTAIRS, KEISHA!!!' ( I'm such a sensitive dad, aren't I? )  Then she went running, crying to her mom.  'Daddy's mad at me, Mommy!'  Soon afterward, Tasha came downstairs, with a t-shirt tied around her mouth and nose (I wish I had the camera), and  heroically  used the pooper scooper to clean up the mess.  Immediately, she put it,  pooper scooper and all , in a plastic bag.  At first I told her that we needed to keep the pooper scooper (I'm having fun typing that, by the way), but then I realized that it was better over all, at least for the short term, to have the mess out of the house.  Later, Tasha came back down with some Lysol (TM, just in case it's needed, you know) cleaner and cleaned up the area.  Well, I think I need to go soon.  I need to floss my teeth, if you know what I mean.          "

"5158",5158,449628,"Aries","              Deaf Culture   I have had the pleasure of meeting a good number of deaf people.  One of the more interesting aspects of communicating with them in sign language is the concept of a 'sign name,' which I'll explain briefly.   In order to keep from having to fingerspell a person's name every time you mention them, it's easier to have a 'sign name.'  This consists of the fingerspelled first letter of the person's name and an action associated with that person.  Whenever I've asked one of my deaf friends to give someone else to whom we're talking a sign name, they usually ask, 'What does he/she like to do?'  In other words, if you had one activity or word to describe you, what would that be?  My wife Jennie, for example, has a beautiful smile.  Keisha, our 5-year old daughter, has curly hair.  I really enjoy playing and listening to music.  So our sign names, respectively, with the right hand, are a fingerspelled 'J' across the right side of the face (smile), a fingerspelled 'K' by the right side of the head in a curling motion (curly hair), and a fingerspelled 'D' in a figure-eight motion across the left arm (music).

All right, then.  Here goes.  This is a little  personal , and maybe a little   gross   -- consider yourself  warned .  This event happens to be  my earliest memory .  I was three years old and I had received an operation to repair a hernia in my groin.  The problem arose when I had an allregic reaction to the catgut stitches that the surgeons used to knit me back up.  The area got infected and, before I could get the stitches out, they needed to get all the pus out.  I remember this scene vividly because when they pushed to squeeze the pus out, the pain was   excruciating  !  I remember screaming and crying because it hurt so bad.  I felt helpless.  After the experience was over, the hospital people gave me a Batman colorforms set for ' being so brave '.  In addition to  Batman , some of my other favorite TV shows were  Shazaam!  and  The Six Million Dollar Man .  Sometimes, Mom would safety pin a towel on my back, and I would race down the steps to our front door and cry out, '  Shazaam!  ', just like the main character did on the show.  Then I would go around looking for problems to fix, bad guys to beat up, and so on.  At other times, I would play with my Steve Austin, Six Million Dollar Man, action figure.  It even had a magnifying glass so that I could look through his right eye, just like the 'real' Steve Austin did on TV.  I remember after coming home from the hospital, we had a family reunion of some type at our house.  Well, I was just so proud, having come off the operating table, that I went around telling people that  I, too, had bionic parts inside me .  And I was just about to show someone by climbing up in one of the trees in front of our house, when Dad caught me.  From that moment throughout my childhood I was not allowed to climb any trees.  I thought Dad just didn't believe, but now I realize that he did want me to go back to the hospital so soon after coming home.  I cannot remember, but maybe a jump like that is what led to my operation in the first place.         "

I was part of a sleep study over ten years ago when I lived in the Detroit, Michigan area.  The researchers were testing to see how drowsy a person taking Benadryl gets.  The first week was going to be a baseline test (i.e., a control test)  I was told that I could not take in any caffeine or chocolate 12 hours before I was to go in.  They should have just put me in jail or something.  I went in at the approved time and also went to a 'hook up' room.  Shortly after they turned off the lights, I was out.  They woke me up in the morning, and boy, did I feel wasted.  They let me eat breakfast, but I was not to drink any caffeine still.  After the breakfast break, I went to a computer terminal and had to take this manual dexterity test.  I was supposed to get a perfect score, considering I hadn't been given any of the Benadryl.  But because I was still so sleepy, every cell in my body begging for rest, I didn't get a good score.  Later that week, I received a check in the mail and was told that they would not need me any more for the current sleep study.  I know it was because I was a poor control guinea pig.  I've considered participating in additional studies because participants get paid.  Maybe soon...         "

"5189",5189,449628,"Aries","              Five Years Ago    I am, for some odd reason, still awake, even though it's after 3 AM   On Thursday, July 17, 1997, at 10:42 PM, our daughter  urlLink Keisha Renee  was born.  This occurred after much hard work and perseverance.  And, oh yes, my wife was there, too! (just kidding, Jen!)  Seriously though -- seeing my wife go through labor generated a whole new dimension of respect for her in me.  I am glad that I will never have to experience that!  I may actually reveal some details about what happened prior to the delivery that day... at some later date.  Tonight we went to  urlLink Max and Erma's on Miller Lane to celebrate.  We all got dressed up:  I in my suit and tie from earlier today;  urlLink Jennie  in a nice outfit that made her look even more beautiful, and Keisha in a nice light blue dress, sporting a tiara and some earrings her speech therapist brought over today.  'Princess' Keisha was beaming as she walked around and sat down.  We let her open two presents as we ate dessert.  She exclaimed, 'I'm so happy!' after she opened them up to find a Barbie and a baby care accessory case for her doll baby Hannah.   (Baby Hannah, by the way, is practically an additional member of the family, thanks to our daughter.  We, however, left her in the  car seat, locked up in the car with the windows closed .  I am glad that she is only a doll because we sure could have gotten in trouble!!! lol)   I am continually amazed at the miracle we see in our daughter Keisha, our gift from God.  For it was only a short time ago that I held her in the crook of my arm, rocking her to sleep.  I miss those times when I'd lay her on my chest and we'd both fall asleep on the couch.  Now she's 44 inches tall, and I can barely pick her up.  She also wants more of her independence.  From what I've heard, this is just the beginning...          "

"5198",5198,449628,"Aries","              Pet Peeve -- Ohio Bicentennial License Plates   Ohio will be celebrating its bicentennial in 2003.  Last September, Ohio began issuing Bicentennial license plates to help commemorate the occasion.  They have red, white, and blue on them, which also makes it patriotic.  These license plates have been a hit, especially considering the renewed patriotism in America.  The designers of this license plate have had to make some changes in the layout to accomodate the additional information.  One of these changes is the county where the license plate holder lives.  (Growing up, our family would often travel from Cincinnati to Toledo where my dad grew up.  One of the ways we'd pass the time is to notice the license plates of the cars around us.  We'd be interested in those from out of state and those from Canada (Ontario), and we'd also notice the different Ohio counties represented.  This tradition is something we still whenever we drive.  It was easy to note which cars are from which county because it was spelled out on the bottom center of the license plate.)  The Ohio Bicentennial license plate now has a small square county sticker with a number corresponding to the alphabetical order of the county in the list of all 88 counties.  For example, I live in Dayton, Ohio, which is in Montgomery county.  In the alphabetical list Montgomery is the 57th county.  I often travel to Cincinnati and back, so I pass through Warren (83), Butler (09), and Hamilton (31).  Now, below this large number is the name of the county, but it is in very small letters.  These numbers are fine and dandy if you've memorized the alphabetical list of the counties.  But who in Ohio has done that?  My guess is that very few, if any, know them all by memory.  (Actually, this was something we had to memorize when I was studying Ohio history in junior high school.  At the time, I didn't think I would need to remember.)  My fellow Ohioans don't appreciate me tailgating them to see which county they are from.  So, what am I to do?  Well, I have compiled the alphabetical list for me personally, and for whomever else is interested.  So here goes:                      01      ADAMS      45      LICKING            02      ALLEN      46      LOGAN            03      ASHLAND      47      LORAIN            04      ASHTABULA      48      LUCAS            05      ATHENS      49      MADISON           06      AUGLAIZE      50      MAHONING            07      BELMONT      51      MARION            08      BROWN      52      MEDINA            09      BUTLER      53      MEIGS            10      CARROLL      54      MERCER            11      CHAMPAIGN      55      MIAMI            12      CLARK      56      MONROE            13      CLERMONT      57      MONTGOMERY            14      CLINTON      58      MORGAN            15      COLUMBIANA      59      MORROW            16      COSHOCTON      60      MUSKINGUM            17      CRAWFORD      61      NOBLE            18      CUYAHOGA      62      OTTAWA            19      DARKE      63      PAULDING            20      DEFIANCE      64      PERRY            21      DELAWARE      65      PICAWAY            22      ERIE      66      PIKE            23      FAIRFIELD      67      PORTAGE            24      FAYETTE      68      PREBLE            25      FRANKLIN      69      PUTNAM            26      FULTON      70      RICHLAND            27      GALLIA      71      ROSS            28      GEAUGA      72      SANDUSKY            29      GREENE      73      SCIOTO            30      GUERNSEY      74      SENECA            31      HAMILTON      75      SHELBY            32      HANCOCK      76      STARK            33      HARDIN      77   SUMMIT            34      HARRISON      78      TRUMBULL            35      HENRY      79      TUSCARAWAS            36      HIGHLAND      80      UNION            37      HOCKING      81      VAN WERT            38      HOLMES      82      VINTON            39      HURON      83      WARREN            40      JACKSON      84      WASHINGTON            41      JEFFERSON      85      WAYNE            42      KNOX      86      WILLIAMS            43      LAKE      87      WOOD            44      LAWRENCE      88      WYANDOT              "

Well, we  urlLink got one of those last night in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA , as, for the first time since 1961, the Major League Baseball All-Star Game ended with a tie: National League 7, American League 7.  As a fan, I don't agree with that above statement.  I feel cheated.  I am from Cincinnati, and the  urlLink Reds  urlLink   had one player,  urlLink Adam Dunn , a former Dayton Dragon, on the National League team.  Given that in the last several All-Star Games, the AL won, that the NL was so close to winning hurts more.  Oh, I'll get over it.  In fact, in the grand scheme of things, it's not that big of a deal.  Yet I can't help feeling robbed.  Major League Baseball, since the strike of 1994, has not been that appealing.  Then we get a no-decision like we had last night.  Now there is talk of a strike this year.  Oh, great.  A glimmer of hope has been the arrival of minor league baseball in Dayton, Ohio.  Fifth Third Field, which seats over 8,000, is always packed, and the Dragons always provide an entertaining experience.    This feels like baseball the way it was when I grew up.  I remember the Big Red Machine of the 70's fondly.  My hero was George Foster.  When I played Little League, I had his number (3) and played his position (Left Field).  I nevertheless couldn't hit very well, and he was a slugger.  I guess we weren't meant to be alike in every way.  How will this season end up?  The Reds are in a pennant race for the NL Central division with the St. Louis Cardinals.  I'd love to see them win the division.  Whether we'll get a chance to see this depends on the outcome of the strike talks and how the teams fare.  I just hope someone wants to win.         "

It also reset users' 'personal profile' settings by adding and pre-selecting a new set of marketing option boxes. This was done to 'make it easier for you to manage the marketing communications you receive from Yahoo'. Funny, for something that is supposed to be good for me that doesn't sound like any fun at all...   'Unfortunately it's not just Yahoo that has adopted this policy. A growing number of Hotmail's 118 million users worldwide report the same thing. The boxes make it appear people have given permission for Hotmail to share their email address, date of birth and other information with websites run by Microsoft's partners.  I recently told a good friend and Hotmail user about this and he rushed to change his personal settings and preferences  reasoning that if they weren't going to protect his privacy, why should he give away accurate personal information?   'Microsoft also wanted access to a huge database of names  which they have of course  but like my friend earlier, a lot of the names are bogus. I have no doubt they'd prefer a smaller, accurate database of paying clients than a few million billgatessux@hotmail.com fakes.'  To change your Personal Profile in  Hotmail , login and navigate to the Options page.  Under the 'Your Information' section is the item 'Personal Profile'.  Click it to change your personal information and uncheck the boxes that say you don't mind sharing your information with Microsoft and its partners.  To change your information in  Yahoo , login and click the link to Mail Options.  Click on the link to Account Information.  I had to re-enter my password and ignore a stupid demographic survey.

"5215",5215,449628,"Aries","              Huge Wins for the Cincinnati Reds and Dayton Dragons   Both Cincinnati and Dayton have something to be excited about as we head into Independence Week.  Today's  urlLink Dayton Daily News reports  that yesterday the  urlLink Reds  (43-37, or a .5375 winning percentage) came within percentage points of tying the  urlLink St. Louis Cardinals  (42-36, or a .5384 winning percentage) for first place in the National League Central Division.  The Reds, you may recall, were predicted not to amount to much in the preseason.  Yet they have not given up and are part of what hopes to be an exciting pennant race for the second half of the baseball season.  Part, if not most, of the reason the Reds are doing so well may be in the young talent they have raised up from their minor league affiliates.  Why, it was only recently, when Adam Dunn, Austin Kearns, and Juan Encarnacion were playing A-ball for the  urlLink Dayton Dragons  in at Fifth Third Field.  Now look at these guys.   urlLink Adam Dunn was the only Cincinnati Red chosen for the All-Star team .  Austin Kearns  urlLink could be Rookie of the Year .  And what of those  urlLink Dayton Dragons ?  Today's  urlLink Dayton Daily News also reports  that the Dragons, with a 4-3 victory over the Fort Wayne Wizards yesterday, have extended their winning streak to 13 games.  One has to wonder if this is the same team that was in second-to-last place after the first half of the season.  Now, since the beginning of the second half, with a clean slate, the Dragons are hot!  It seems that everything is coming together for the minor league team: pitching, fielding, and hitting.  One player of note is outfielder Chris Williamson.  In his last three games he has produced three homers and 12 RBIs to go with a .415 batting average.  Even with all the great things happening for the team, the players are still forced to keep things in perspective.  As Williamson puts it: 'We're not all here about winning championships.  We're here to develop players.'  We certainly have witnessed the results in Dunn, Kearns, and Encarnacion.  Keep it up, guys.  I certainly am enjoying it.         "

We have only one child: our daughter Keisha Renee.  No one in our family has that name.  My maternal grandmother's name was Loraine, but we thought - especially after consulting my wife - that Keisha Loraine was not a good idea -  punny , but not the best choice (Ever heard of Quiche Lorraine?).  Actually, the name Keisha Renee just came to me one day.  It sounded beautiful.  Some time after she was born I looked both names up in a baby name book.  'Keisha' is derived from the same African-American word that means 'newly created.'  'Renee' is French for 'reborn.'  Hence, we've considered her name an inspiration from God: She was our 'newly-created' child, and our desire is for her, when she gets old enough to make the decision to follow God for the rest of her life, that she will be 'reborn.'  God has not yet allowed us to have any more children, but if we could have a son, we would name him Caleb William.  We like 'Caleb' because it means 'faithful,' after  urlLink the man in the Old Testament with the same name .  William was my father-in-law's name.           "

"5224",5224,449628,"Aries","              The Most ADHD-type Album I've Heard This Year   (subtitled - Should I Start Yet Another Blog?)    BACKGROUND  urlLink From CDD.gov    Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common childhood behavioral disorders and can persist through adolescence and into adulthood. The causes are currently unknown.    What is ADHD?    According to the 2000 American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV-TR), ADHD is a Disruptive Behavior Disorder characterized by on-going inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity occurring in several settings and more frequently and severely than is typical for individuals in the same stage of development. Symptoms begin before age 7 years and can cause serious difficulties in home, school or work life. ADHD can be managed through behavioral or medical interventions, or a combination of the two.    THE MOST ADHD-TYPE ALBUM I'VE HEARD THIS YEAR   With the above, 'official' definition in mind, I wanted to share that I finally listened to  urlLink Tim McGraw's recent album 'Set This Circus Down,'  and as I read the words to the songs, I was struck by how 'ADHD' they sounded.  I don't think that was the original intent, but this is probably a by-product of the recording.  I'm sure many others have listened to it and provided their own reviews, but, since I am ADHD, I feel that I can relate a lot to this album.  It's almost as though it describes my life, or the path, without conscious effort, that my life could take.  Especially the Chorus from the first song,  urlLink 'The Cowboy In Me' , which was written by  urlLink Craig Wisemand, Jeffery Steele, and Al Anderson :    The urge to run the restlessness The heart of stone I sometimes get The things I've done for foolish pride The me that's never satisfied The face that's in the mirror when I don't like what I see I guess that's just the cowboy in me     Aha!  So that's what it is!  It makes a little bit of sense, when you think about the original cowboy-types, who risked everything to go west and search for a better life.  A lot of this ADHD behavior was indeed useful back then, right California?  So, we descendents of these cowboys are now ADHD.  Interesting, isn't it?   SHOULD I START YET ANOTHER BLOG?   Which brings me to my other thought.  I already contribute to  urlLink six blogs, five of which I own . (By the way,  urlLink I'm still looking for contributors to Get That Job! )  I can see a potential for a blog related to ADD/ADHD.  I suppose that my interest in separating the   'mind spillage'   is so that those on the ' urlLink Journey Inside My Mind ' may know that they can take a specific path if they so desire.  If they want to search the  urlLink quotes archive , then go there.  If they want to read some  urlLink creative writing , then by all means, knock yourself out.  Should they desire to  urlLink 'Get That Job!' , then go for it.  Care to read some of my  urlLink 'Letters to God' ? Don't let me hold you back.  Or, if you're experiencing 'Blogger's Block', then check out some  urlLink potential blogging topics .  If you want to  urlLink experience the hodgepodge , then stick around here.  I'm just wondering if I devoted an entire blog to ADHD, would people be interested in it and would I benefit from it.  'I guess that's just the cowboy in me.'         "

My Dad , for whom I was named.  I am so much like him, and I don't even have to try.  I've been realizing this so much more as I've grown up into a husband and father.  In addition to the same name, I have his sense of humor, 'interesting' outlook on life, and eclectic taste in music.  I mentioned this to him one Christmas in a plaque I gave him.  I spent my adolescent years with him, and to this day, he is one of the most important people in my life.   My Mom , who named me after my father.  I've said that I'm a lot like my dad, but I am also much like my mom.  Though most of my life we've lived over 1000 miles from each other, I have felt closer to her than any of my other blood relatives.     urlLink Favorite child, etc. :  I am considered by many in my family to be my mom's favorite.

In the Fall of 2000 I was diagnosed with depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, and anxiety disorder.  Based on my family's medical history, I also was considered to be at risk for having a manic episode, which is part of bipolar disorder.  I went to therapy and took some medicine, but I never could feel that it was working completely.  At times I felt that I couldn't understand what was going on, what the illness was, etc.  Then,  urlLink this past January,  I started seeing a different psychiatrist who concluded that I was misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder and instead showed a lot of signs for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).  So I began taking some medicine to help with that.  Currently, I am off the ADD medicine, and I am looking for non-medical methods of dealing with what goes on inside me.  I believe that ADHD is the better diagnosis, based on what I've learned about it.  I am also learning to appreciate it more.  Moreover, I understand better how it relates with the other mental stuff I am dealing with.           "

So from 10 to 3 today I ran around with her at the museum.  It was a great experience, and both of us had a great time.  After we left and were driving home, I told Keisha that we did a lot today and asked her what she liked the best.  She could not remember it all.  I wasn't surprised.  It's hard for  me  to remember everything we did.  But I related to her some of the exhibits we saw, and I could tell that she really enjoyed the time we spent together.

"5234",5234,449628,"Aries","              'Water Meter Man!'   We just had a visit from Water-Meter Man!  The entire visit lasted a maximum of 30 seconds, but my life is forever changed!!! Seriously, though, I've often wondered what these guys are thinking as they go inside peoples' houses.  My daughter, still in her night clothes, answered the door, but fortunately, did not open it.  Our 5-month old puppy has a coniption fit ('good boy!').  My lovely wife and partner, who is faithfully doing laundry, reminded me that the light above our water meter is out.  So I came upstairs from blogging, and let Water-Meter Man in, amid the loudness of 'Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat' (my hearing-impaired daughter does not have her hearing aids in).  I, bearing flashlight/radio/emergency siren/weather radio, let Water-Meter Man inside (I said that already), explaining to him that our light downstairs where the meter is doesn't work.  So I lead him downstairs, shine the light, he glances at the meter, enters something into his 'magical gadget', and heads back upstairs and out the door.  All this in less than one minute.  'Have a nice day,' I said, as he left our castle.  I quickly locked our door.  Afterward, I encouraged our daughter for coming to get us after opening the door to reveal 'Water-Meter Man', and I taught her to come get us whenever someone else comes to our door.  And 'normal' life resumed.  And that's all I have to say about that.         "

I remember the anger I felt at the kid down the street, who wouldn't trade me the card I needed for a duplicate one that I had.  I keep a lot of my original writing, which I wrote back in high school and college.  Once I found my 'voice', so to speak (no pun intended), I found that I really enjoy writing.

She handed out a flyer with the following text on it:   A blood donor is good for people who go through windshields and red lights.  For  Someone with cancer, hemophilia, or anemia.  Or hepatitis.  Or ulcers.   For  people being operated on.   For  people into feudin' and fightin'.    For  people who are almost out of life because they are almost out of blood.   For  a little girl who doesn't know that leukemia has happened to her.  Or why.   For  a little boy who needs something revved up that wound down.  Like energy.   For  people having open-heart surgery.   For  people who need a blood donor and also an organ donor -- a part as well as a pint -- a new heart or new liver, a lung or a kidney.   For  new babies needing new blood.  Or new mothers needing a transfusion.   For  little kids who get into something poison or fall onto something sharp.   For  people who fool around with something that explodes, goes off, bites or shatters.   For  people burned pretty bad.   For  daredevils.  Tree climbers.   For  people at the wrong place at the wrong time.  A blood donor is good for people who are in a lot worse shape than most people you know.  Someone needs a lot of your blood a lot.  ---------- What are  your  reasons for not being a regular blood donor?  I will be eligible to donate again the first or second week in October.         "

Maybe your comments will help me.  Now, I cannot guarantee that anything I type henceforth in this post will be grammatically correct or will even make any sense at all.

I am talking about those blogs that are about technology, cooking,  urlLink help with blogger's block , creative writing,  urlLink quotations ,  urlLink job hunting , and so on.  Someone who wants to read about technology has a better chance of finding something in a blog that is more techology-based, for example.

Actually, I am eager for others to sign up as regular contributors or occasional contributors. So let me know if you are interested!

"5270",5270,449628,"Aries","              When Should Your Child Stay Home?    The nurses at Keisha's preschool gave us this information at the Open House.  Some of it is self-explanatory, but some of it might not be.    If your child has any of the following symptoms he/she should be kept at home and the teacher notified of the reason for the absence.   Fever Vomiting Diarrhea (one or more loose stools in a 24-hour period) Unexplained rash Red, watery or draining eyes Open sores, especially around the nose or mouth Bugs or eggs in the hair Earache or ear drainage Yellow or green drainage from the nose More than an occasional cough Wheezing/difficulty breathing Unable to eat or drink a regular diet   If your child is not interested in playing and eating and wants to lie down, he/she should be watched and the child's temperature checked.  Do not send the child to school if you give a fever-reducing medicine such as Tylenol.   Question for you, gentle reader: what is it about the symptoms above that makes them important enough to warrant keeping a child home from school?         "

But now, with the explosion of personal online journals known as Weblogs, anyone with something to say and access to the right software can be a publisher, a pundit and observer of events great and small.          Weblogs  personal online journals, saturated with attitude and rich with links to Internet resources  have transformed and democratized the media landscape. What had once quietly flourished in the grassroots of cyberspace has now burst into the mainstream, transforming the way Internet news and communities are perceived.          Thats why MSNBC is launching Weblog Central, your gateway to the world of personal news.

I used to have nightmares of being hurled toward a tall mountain  I have never danced with the devil in the pale moonlight  I have never been shot.          "

Kinda makes me want to floss so that I can keep my own teeth awhile longer...         "

"5392",5392,449628,"Aries","              Journey Inside My Mind: Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder   One of the main reasons I started this weblog was to be able to document the so-called 'journey inside my mind'.  I tend to be rather neurotic, and I've often not been able to understand why my world seems to be in a whirlwind and out of control.  Since undergoing therapy, I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder (aka manic depression), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).  Throughout a lot of this journey, I've tried to learn as much about the mental illnesses as possible to see how and where I fit in.  The idea is to glean from others' knowledge so that I can get well.  I'm currently being seen by a psychiatrist and a counselor, and the diagnosis is what the doc referred to as 'process OCD', which I'm understanding as Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD).  It is true that I have some of the 'content OCD' symptoms: I pick at scabs, touch my face or hands excessively, etc.  But the big thing is that my 'process' of doing things is so rigid.  So I'm journeying to discover more about this OCPD, and, thanks to the folks at Yahoo!, I was able to find a  urlLink web site that defines OCPD .  I link to it here more for my benefit, but if you also benefit, then that's a bonus.          "
"5393",5393,449628,"Aries","              Veteran's Day   from email (thanks to Jeff I.)    What is a Vet?    He is the cop on the beat who spent six months in Saudi Arabia sweating two gallons a day making sure the armored personnel carriers didn't run out of fuel. He is the barroom loudmouth, dumber than five wooden planks, whose overgrown frat-boy behavior is outweighed a hundred times in the cosmic scales by four hours of exquisite bravery near the 38th parallel. She (or he) is the nurse who fought against futility and went to sleep sobbing every night for two solid years in Da Nang. He is the POW who went away one person and came back another - or didn't come back AT ALL. He is the Parris Island drill instructor who has never seen combat - but has saved countless lives by turning slouchy, no-account rednecks and gang members into Marines, and teaching them to watch each other's backs. He is the parade-riding Legionnaire who pins on his ribbons and medals with a prosthetic hand. He is the career quartermaster who watches the ribbons and medals pass him by. He is the three anonymous heroes in The Tomb Of The Unknowns, whose presence at the Arlington National Cemetery must forever preserve the memory of all anonymous heroes whose valor dies unrecognized with them on the battlefield or in the ocean's sunless deep. He is the old guy bagging groceries at the supermarket - palsied now and aggravatingly slow - who helped liberate a Nazi death camp and who wishes all day long that his wife were still alive to hold him when the nightmares come. He is an ordinary and yet an extraordinary human being - a person who offered some of his life's most vital years in the service of his country, and who sacrificed his ambitions so others would not have to sacrifice theirs. He is a soldier and a savior and a sword against the darkness, and he is nothing more than the finest, greatest testimony on behalf of the finest, greatest nation ever known.  So remember, each time you see someone who has served our country, just lean over and say Thank You. That's all most people need, and in most cases it will mean more than any medals they could have been awarded or were awarded.   Two little words that mean a lot: 'THANK YOU.'  It's the soldier, not the reporter, who gave us our freedom of the press.  It's the soldier, not the poet, who gave us our freedom of speech.  It's the soldier, not the campus organizer, who gave us our freedom to demonstrate.  It's the soldier, who salutes the flag, who serves others with respect for the flag, and whose coffin is draped by the flag, who allows the protester to burn the flag.    Prayer for our Servicemen   Lord, hold our troops in Your loving hands.  Protect them as they protect us.   Bless them and their families for the selfless acts they perform for us in our time of need.  I ask this in the name of Jesus, our Lord and Savior.  Amen.  When you've read this, please stop for a moment and say a prayer for our service men and women stationed all over the world.  There is nothing attached...Of all the gifts you could give a U. S. serviceman, prayer is the very best one.         "

"5396",5396,449628,"Aries","              TWO FROGS   A group of frogs were traveling through the woods, and two of them fell into a deep pit. All the other frogs gathered around the pit. When they saw how deep the pit was, they told the unfortunate frogs they would never get out.   The two frogs ignored the comments and tried to jump up out of the pit.  The other frogs kept telling them to stop, that they were as good as dead. Finally, one of the frogs took heed to what the other frogs were saying and simply gave up. He fell down and died.  The other frog continued to jump as hard as he could. Once again, the crowd of frogs yelled at him to stop the pain and suffering and just die. He jumped even harder, and finally, he made it out.  When he got out, the other frogs asked him, 'Why did you continue jumping? Didn't you hear us?' The frog explained to them that he was deaf. He thought they were encouraging him the entire time.  This story teaches two lessons:  There is power of life and death in the tongue. An encouraging word to someone who is down can lift them up and help them make it through the day. A destructive word to someone who is down can be what it takes to kill them. Be careful of what you say. Speak life to those who cross your path.   The power of words ... it is sometimes hard to understand that an encouraging word can go such a long way. Anyone can speak words that tend to rob another of the spirit to continue in difficult times.  Special is the individual who will take the time to encourage another.  That's what I'm doing here.  Cheers!         "

"5443",5443,449628,"Aries","              A Santa Claus Story    from my friend Laura H. from high school :  I remember my first Christmas party with Grandma.  I was just a kid.  I remember tearing across town on my bike to visit her on the day my big sister dropped the bomb: 'There is no Santa Claus,' she jeered.  'Even dummies know that!'  My grandma was not the gushy kind, never had been.  I fled to her that day because I knew she would be straight with me.  I knew Grandma always told the truth, and I knew that the truth always went down a whole lot easier when swallowed with one of her world-famous cinnamon buns.  Grandma was home, and the buns were still warm.  Between bites I told her everything.  She was ready for me.  'No Santa Claus?' she snorted.  'Ridiculous!  Don't believe it.  That rumor has been going around for years, and it makes me mad, plain mad.  Now, put on your coat, and let's go.'  'Go?  Go where, Grandma?' I asked.  I hadn't even finished my second cinnamon bun.    'Where' turned out to be Kerby's General Store, the one store in town that had a little bit of just about everything.  As we walked through its doors, Grandma handed me ten dollars.  That was a bundle in those days.  'Take this money and buy something for someone who needs it.  I'll wait for you in the car.'  Then she turned and walked out of Kerby's.  I was only eight years old.  I'd often gone shopping with my mother, but never had I shopped for anything all by myself.  The store seemed big and crowded, full of people scrambling to finish their Christmas shopping.  For a few moments I just stood there, confused, clutching that ten-dollar bill, wondering what to buy, and who on earth to buy it for.  I thought of everybody I knew:  my family, my friends, my neighbors, the kids at school, the people who went to my church.  I was just about thought out, when I suddenly thought of Bobbie Decker.  He was a kid with bad breath and messy hair, and he sat right behind me in Mrs. Pollock's grade-two class.  Bobbie Decker didn't have a coat.  I knew that because he never went out for recess during the winter.  His mother always wrote a note, telling the teacher that he had a cough, but all we kids knew that Bobbie Decker didn't have a cough, and he didn't have a coat.  I fingered the ten-dollar bill with growing excitement.  I would buy Bobbie Decker a coat.  I settled on a red corduroy one that had a hood to it.  It looked real warm and he would like that.  'Is this a Christmas present for someone?' the lady behind the counter asked kindly, as I laid my ten dollars down.    'Yes,' I replied shyly.  'It's for Bobbie.'  The nice lady smiled at me.  I didn't get any change, but she put the coat in a bag and wished me a Merry Christmas.  That evening, Grandma helped me wrap the coat in Christmas paper and ribbons, and write, 'To Bobbie, From Santa Claus' on it.  Grandma said that Santa always insisted on secrecy.  Then she drove me over to Bobbie Decker's house, explaining as we went that I was now and forever officially one of Santa's helpers.  Grandma parked down the street from Bobbie's house, and she and I crept noiselessly and hid in the bushes by his front walk.  Then Grandma gave me a nudge.  'All right, Santa Claus,' she whispered, 'get going.'  I took a deep breath, dashed for his front door, threw the present down on his step, pounded his doorbell and few back to the safety of the bushes and Grandma.  Together we waited breathlessly in the darkness for the front door to open.  Finally it did, and there stood Bobbie.  Forty years haven't dimmed the thrill of those moments spent shivering, beside my grandma, in Bobbie Decker's bushes.  That night, I realized that those awful rumors about Santa Claus were just what Grandma said they were: ridiculous.  Santa was alive and well, and we were on his team.         "

"5472",5472,449628,"Aries","              Aside | My Special Girl     urlLink Our five-year old daughter Keisha  is hearing-impaired and has to wear hearing aids.     Seeing those words I just typed cuts my heart still.  It's been almost two years since we found out that she had hearing loss.  It was determined that her cochleas, the spiral-shaped part of the inner ear, were never fully developed.  I bring this up because within the last couple of days we've been reminded of it, and, while we've grown to accept it, it still hurts in our hearts.  We realize even more how fragile we human beings are, and how much more we need God.  This past Sunday we spent some time with some friends from church.  They have two daughters: one who is eight and one who is eleven months.  Rachel, the eight year old, asked me, 'When is Keisha not going to have to wear her hearing aids anymore?'    I replied, 'Never.  She will most probably always have to wear hearing aids for the rest of her life.'  The finality of that statement struck an emotional chord that hadn't been touched in awhile.  Then, yesterday evening, as my wife was tucking Keisha into her bed, she observed something else.  Keisha has to take her hearing aids off before she goes to sleep, and as Jennie was tucking her in, Keisha brought out a stuffed bear.  This bear, when you squeeze its hand, sings 'Jesus Loves Me' and says the 'Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep' prayer.  She received it from her aunt a couple years ago.  Keisha squeezed the bear, and it started playing 'Jesus Loves Me'.  Jennie, my wife, noticed that Keisha had put the speaker part of the bear, from which the music issued, against her ear just so that she could hear it.  At first Jennie thought that the batteries might need to be replaced, but when Keisha had it play 'Jesus Loves Me' again, Jennie could tell that the batteries were okay.  It was just that Keisha needed to have the speaker up to her ear so that she could hear it better.  Then she put it up to Jennie's ear as though that was the only way that Jennie could hear it, too.  The doctors have said that Keisha's hearing loss can get progressively worse.  This is one of the reasons why we're all learning sign language, even Nana, who has come to live with us recently.  I also think that it is great that Keisha herself sees the benefit of having the hearing aids, or 'magic ears', as we like to call them.  I think she is aware of how special she is, and that she definitely feels everyone's love.  We all understand that Keisha is exactly how God wanted her.  Everyone in our household, except for the dog, ails with something.  For Keisha, it's her hearing loss.  For my Mom and me, it's our mental illnesses.  For Jennie, it's probably a hormonal imbalance of some kind.  It's very humbling.  Not only that, but it's also encouraging as we continue to remind ourselves that, ailments and all, we are  urlLink 'fearfully and wonderfully made' (Psalm 139:13-14) .  Seeing myself - ourselves - in this light is definitely a good thing.         "

"5502",5502,449628,"Aries","              Paving the Milestones   urlLink    While sorting through some old files and stuff tonight, I came upon a treasure:  my junior year College Prep English class research paper, dated May 11, 1987.  It was entitled 'Paving the Milestones (Miles Dewey Davis III)'.  The purpose of the research paper was to describe how an important individual has had an impact on society.  I chose to do my research paper on Miles Davis because I was a jazzmaniac (I may need to get that word trademarked, by the way), and loved his music.  Little did I know how much my research into his persona, his 'mystique', if you will, would affect me as an individual.  There I was, an insecure junior in high school, struggling to find myself.  And what joy I found by learning about the man,  urlLink Miles Davis , who lived his life caring so much less about what other people thought than what he thought of himself.  I decided to imitate his 'devil may care' qualities, and it showed.  Toward the beginning of our research we all were called upon to present some preliminary findings to the class.  Our presentation would be videotaped, and our peers would critique us.  I was unprepared, anxious and insecure, as usual.  But my zeal, enthusiasm, and overal 'jazzmania' (there's that word again), was definitely evident.  I felt like the presentation was a disaster, but then again, I was the first presenter in our teacher's little experiment.  When the time came for us to give a final presentation, I again was chosen to go first.  This time, armed with my own 'mystique', I blew the class and my teacher away with an excellent presentation.  First of all, I had purchased a toy trumpet.  I began my presentation, with my back to my audience and played the tune most often heard at the beginning of horse races; it was the only one I knew how to play on that thing.  Secondly, after explaining how Miles pioneered modalism with his album   urlLink Kind of Blue  , I played the opening riff of ' urlLink So What ' on my alto saxophone.  My peers were, as I said, blown away.  My teacher was impressed with my boldness.  I got an 'A'.

More reason why we should reduce the size of government:   Everyone who has ever bought a house can enjoy this.. (or dealt with bureaucrats)  A New Orleans lawyer sought an FHA (Federal Housing Admin) loan for a client.  He was told the loan would be granted if he could prove satisfactory title to a parcel of property being offered as collateral. The title to the property dated back to 1803, which took the lawyer three months to track down.  After sending the information to the FHA, he received the following  reply (actual letter): 'Upon review of your letter adjoining your client's loan application, we note that the request is supported by an Abstract of Title. While we compliment the able manner in which you have prepared and presented the application, we must point out that you have only cleared title to the proposed collateral property back to 1803.  Before final approval can be accorded, it will be necessary to clear the title back to its origin.' Annoyed, the lawyer responded as follows (actual letter): 'Your letter regarding title in Case No. 189156 has been received.  I note that you wish to have title extended further than the 194 years covered by the present application.  I was unaware that any educated person in this country, particularly those working in the property area, would not know that Louisiana was purchased by the U.S. from France in 1803, the year of origin identified in our application.    For the edification of uninformed FHA bureaucrats, the title to the land prior to U.S. ownership was obtained from France, which had acquired it by Right of Conquest from Spain.  The land came into the possession of Spain by Right of Discovery made in the year 1492 by a sea captain named Christopher Columbus, who had been granted the privilege of seeking a new route to India by the Spanish monarch, Isabella.  The good queen, Isabella, being pious woman and almost as careful about titles as the FHA, took the precaution of securing the blessing of the Pope before she sold her jewels to finance Columbus' expedition.  Now the Pope, as I'm sure you may know, is [considered by many at the time to be] the emissary of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and God, it is commonly accepted, created this world.  Therefore, I believe it is safe to presume that God also made that part of the world called Louisiana.  God, therefore, would be the owner of origin and His origins date back, to before the beginning of time, the world as we know it AND the FHA.  I hope the hell you find God's original claim to be satisfactory.  Now, may we have our damn loan?' The loan was approved.         "

Pursuant to the authority granted the undersigned by Section 890.09(b), Ordinance No. 086-22, as amended, City of Middletown, Ohio, you are hereby ordered to appear at the office of the Superintendent of Taxation, One Donham Plaza, Middletown, Ohio on the   30th day of JANUARY 2002, at 11:15AM  to be examined under oath at a hearing concerning your failure to   FILE YOUR 2001 CITY OF MIDDLETOWN INCOME TAX RETURN.  You are further directed to bring with you   all information necessary to file your return, along with the full remittance due including penalty and interest charges.  Failure to comply with this supoena constitues a violation of said Ordinance subjecting you to a fine of not more than $500.00 or imprisonment not more than 60 days or both, as provided in Section 890.09 thereof.  Signed, Linda Davies Stubbs, Superintendent of Taxation  Issued under the authority of Section 890.09, Ordinance no. 086-22, as amended, City of Middletown, Ohio, by the Superintendent of Taxation.  Mailed: January 15, 2003   I kinda prefer the words  urlLink Lorem Ipsum  better.  Or even a summons to perform jury duty.   Update:   We went to the Middletown Tax office this morning and took care of the situation.  A representative from their office completed our 2001 City of Middletown Income Tax return, and it turned out that we only had to pay a little shy of US$256, which is a lot better than a $500 fine or jail time.  I still wouldn't have minded jury duty that much, though.         "

"5519",5519,449628,"Aries","              Making Pancakes   Another friend of mine, Corky A., who was in my wedding, forwarded this to me: Six-year-old Brandon decided one Saturday morning to fix his parents pancakes. He found a big bowl and spoon, pulled a chair to the counter, opened the cupboard and pulled out the heavy flour canister, spilling it on the floor. He scooped some of the flour into the bowl with his hands, mixed in most of a cup of milk and added some sugar, leaving a floury trail on the floor which by now had a few tracks left by his kitten. Brandon was covered with flour and getting frustrated. He wanted this to be something very good for Mom and Dad, but it was getting very bad. He didn't know what to do next, whether to put it all into the oven or on the stove and he didn't know how the stove worked!)  Suddenly he saw his kitten licking from the bowl of mix and reached to push her away, knocking the egg carton to the floor. Frantically he tried to clean up this monumental mess but slipped on the eggs, getting his pajamas white and sticky.  And just then he saw Dad standing at the door.  Big crocodile tears welled up in Brandon's eyes. All he'd wanted to do was something good, but he'd made a terrible mess. He was sure a scolding was coming, maybe even a spanking. But his father just watched him.  Then, walking through the mess, Dad picked up his crying son, hugged him and loved him, getting his own pajamas white and sticky in the process.  That's how God deals with us. We try to do something good in life, but it turns into a mess. Our marriage gets all sticky or we insult a friend, or we can't stand our job, or our health goes sour. Sometimes we just stand there in tears because we can't think of anything else to do.  That's when God picks us up and loves us and forgives us, even though some of our mess gets all over Him.  But just because we might mess up, we can't stop trying to 'makepancakes' for God or for others. Sooner or later we'll get it right, and then they'll be glad we tried...  Please pass some of this love on to others....suppose one morning you were called to God; do all your friends know you love them?  I was thinking ... and I wondered if I had any wounds needing to be healed, friendships that need rekindling or three words needing to be said. Sometimes, 'I love you' can heal & bless.  Remind every one of your friends that you love them, even if you think they don't love back.  You would be amazed at what those three little words, a smile, and a reminder like this can do. So I share this with you, and offer this encouragement.  Share this with everyone you love, and make sure to share it again with the person who shared it with you. And never stop 'making pancakes'!!!         "
"5520",5520,449628,"Aries","              Prayer Request   Last week, I received another email from my good friend and sister in Christ, Dana B.  She writes: I have a personal prayer request for everyone.  As most people know I have two girls: Hailie is 6 years old and Stevie is 4 years old.  Well, Hailie had been complaining of lower back pain, so we went to the family doctor who requested an X-ray.  It came back showing what looked like a hairline fracture so we were sent to an orthopedic doctor.    [The orthopedic doctor] looked at the X-ray and agreed he saw something but was not 100% sure, so she had a bone scan done about two weeks ago.  She had her follow up appointment yesterday.  My prayer was answered that it was not cancer or a tumor.  But we were told she has a condition called 'Spondylolysis,' and basically that means that on her lumbar 5 vertebra, she has a crack where it looks like the fork (I do not know how to totally explain it).    Usually this happens to children that are older and are more athletic.  So they are thinking she was born with it.  But the specialist will be monitoring her to see if it will heal.  If it does not heal, they will try these steps in order:  Physical therapy, Back brace, and last would be Surgery.   Basically what can happen is if it does not heal, the crack can totally break and there would be a shift in that vertebra, and that would cause the nerves to be exposed.  I am understanding this is not a totally crisis condition but I am requesting your prayers that the situation can be stablized and that no more damage will be done.    It is hard to understand that a 6 year old is dealling with this.  If she can have back pain at 6, how will this effect her later in life?  I guess I should not worry about this.  God is already in control and knows the outcome already.  I am at peace with that.  Well, thanks for taking a moment to read about my prayer request.  I love you all.

"5522",5522,449628,"Aries","              More Customer No-Service  the public school transportation system  Over the last month or so, we've lost much faith in our public school's transportation system.  This morning things came to a head, and I burned with anger once more.  At the beginning of the year we were told what time to expect our daughter's morning and afternoon buses.  Then, within the last month, the morning and afternoon times have been pushed back further and further.  A couple weeks ago, I had called the transportation office and was told that we should call them if the bus was over ten minutes late from what her pickup/dropoff time was.  That time was, in fact, much later than what we were told at the beginning of the school year.  I was quite understanding when told that the reason Keisha's bus was late was because some parents were either not prepared with their kids to leave in the morning or were not at home when the kids were being dropped off in the afternoon.  No problem, I thought.  As long as we know what time we need to have our daughter ready in the morning and what time to expect her when we come home.  We had even begun accomodating the fact that since our daughter was sometimes late for school, she'd miss having breakfast with the other kids at 9:15.  So we'd started giving her something to eat before her bus came.  Again, no problem.  As long as we know what time we need to have our daughter ready in the morning and what time to expect her when we come home.  This morning I received a call from home.  It was mom.  It was already 9:20 and Keisha's bus had still not come.  Mom had a very important doctor's appointment at 10 AM.  She had called the transportation office and was rebuffed by the 'Customer No-Service Representative'.  So I called.  But, while I was talking, this woman began interrupting me.  I told her to stop doing that, and, finally asked for the name of her supervisor.  She did me one better and proceeded to connect me.    After almost 50 rings, I hung up and searched online for Superintendent Percy Mack's phone number.  The secretary, after hearing my complaint, transferred me to the head of Transportation, a Mr. Sullivan's office.  I voiced my complaint again to his secretary, who then asked for my phone number and promised that she would forward this on to Mr. Sullivan and the transportation person in charge of my daughters bussing.  I then told her that I  expected  a return phone call later today, and we hung up.  Now if I don't hear back after 1 PM, guess who's gonna follow up?         "

"5525",5525,449628,"Aries","              I Want To Fire My Bank   For some time now, we have been neither been able to access our primary bank account online nor use our debit card.  This past Saturday morning, Jennie and I went to the branch of the bank, the one where we had opened the account five years ago.  We went to a teller and told her what the situation was.    After some initial research, she got her supervisor.  Her supervisor told us that our account had been blocked from access because of the repeated history of overdrafts to our account.  I responded, loud enough for other patrons to hear: 'So, we're bad people and we'll no longer be able to access our account?'  'Well, no, Mr. Johnson.  You just need to call our 1-800 number or come into the branch where you opened the account.'  'Excuse me, but that's where  I am ,' I replied.  'Well, we can clear that up for you, Mr. Johnson.  We just want to warn you that, if your account gets into an overdraft condition again, then your account will get the block on it.'  'Okay then,' I answered, 'so after this, we'll be able to access our account online and use our debit card?'  'Yes.'  Then we deposited my paycheck and left, believing that things would be okay.  Page forward to Sunday - yesterday.  On our way home from church, we stopped to fill up our gas tank, using our debit card, which doubles as a 'fake' credit card; i.e., so that we can use it to buy gasoline.  The gas station offered 'pay at the pump', so I kept the car running while I emerged from our car to check if our card would go through.  No such luck.  So we went to the nearest bank branch that we knew would be open on a Sunday, which was inside a local supermarket.  As we walked to the tellers station, we noticed that they had some Super Bowl cookies for customers to enjoy.  We explained our situation to the teller, who then proceeded to get some help from her colleague.  'Hmm.  It seems that your home branch has placed a block on the account on  any  debits.'  'We were just there yesterday!' I exclaimed in unbelief.  'Does this mean we can't even write a check to get money out of our account?' again, loud enough for other patrons to hear.  'I'm afraid it does, sir.  Your home branch placed the block, and they have to be the one to unblock the account.'  'I thought we took care of that  yesterday !  This is bull!!' I yelled, and proceeded to storm out of the store.  Fortunately, I remembered to wait for my wife and daughter.  After we had gotten into the car, Keisha proceeded to ask, 'Do we not have any money, Daddy?'  'I don't want to talk about it right now, Keisha,' I replied.  So then she asked Jennie.  'Keisha, I said not to talk about it, okay?'  After some gentle nudging from Jennie, Keisha got the hint.  To add insult to injury, we arrived back home to discover that our car could not make it up our driveway.  Frustrated and angrier, I drove to the end of the cul de sac, turned around and tried again.  Alas, to no avail.  Now, more frustrated and angry, I turned the car around and began to drive in the other direction.  'Why don't we get out and shovel the driveway?'  Jennie asked.  'FINE!'  I said, as I deserted the car, leaving it in neutral with the door open.  Jennie would take over the car, and I would shovel.  I got our shovel, and managed to shovel half the driveway before I ran out of steam.  Frustrated, angry, and tired, I  threw  the shovel across the yard in a fit of rage.  Then I sulked momentarily.  I decided to try again, and got more frustrated that the snow wasn't coming up as easily as I wanted it to.  I began to beat the snow on our driveway, yelling at it, and again threw it across the yard in another fit of rage.  Fortunately, I had cleared enough snow so that Jennie could drive the car up the driveway.  After she had pulled the car into the garage, I picked up the shovel, and put it back in the garage.  Then I went around to the backyard and wept.  I was so frustrated, angry, depressed, and altogether upset.  I sat down against our back wall for a little bit.  Then I noticed that our puppy had emerged from the garage and was on his chain.  He came over and licked me, which helped me feel a bit better.  Then, in a playful mood, I began to throw snow on him, which he appeared to enjoy.  So I piled as much snow on him as I could.  Then I got up, strolled over to the virgin snow in an untouched part of our backyard, and laid myself down.  It was rather peaceful and quiet.  I didn't feel quite so cold yet.  I thought about how I was feeling, prayed to God, and asked for his forgiveness for my fits of rage.  I'm learning that I don't know how to express my anger constructively.  I told Jennie in the car on the way back home that I felt like writing a scathing letter to the president of our bank, using the F-word, the S-word, and the D-word a lot in my letter.  I don't usually curse, but those words seemed appropriate at the time.  As did the thought of tearing the bank manager a new bodily orifice, if you know what I mean.  Jennie remarked that we should have just walked out of the bank office with all of their Super Bowl cookies.         "

"5528",5528,449628,"Aries","              Thought Process   My friend Bill T. sent this to me via email:  A few years ago, at the Seattle Special Olympics, nine contestants, all physically or mentally disabled, assembled at the starting line for the 100-yard dash. At the gun, they all started out, not exactly in a dash, but with a relish to run the race to the finish and win. All, that is, except one little boy who stumbled on the asphalt, tumbled over a couple of times, and began to cry. The other eight heard the boy cry. They slowed down and looked back. Then they all turned around and went back... every one of them. One girl with Down's Syndrome bent down and kissed him and said, 'This will make it better.'  Then all nine linked arms and walked together to the finish line. Everyone in the stadium stood, and the cheering went on for several minutes. People who were there are still telling the story.  Why? Because deep down we know this one thing: What matters in this life is more than winning for ourselves. What matters in this life is helping others win, even if it means slowing down and changing our course. What do you think?         "

When we got off I-70, we drove to the  urlLink Danbarry Cinemas  to see what was playing.  Keisha and I bought our tickets and then drove to the Huber Heights  urlLink McDonald's , which has a huge PlayPlace.  After getting our food, we sat down in the PlayPlace area to eat.  Keisha was so excited to play that she didn't even open up the  urlLink two toys she had gotten in her Happy Meal .  We had enough time for her to go through the PlayPlace one time before we needed to head back to the movie theatre.  Upon arriving at the movie theatre we bought a box of  urlLink Milk Duds  and proceeded to where ' urlLink Spy Kids 2 ' was showing.  I let Keisha pick out the place for us to sit, and she chose front row, stage center.  I think that there were only two other people in the theatre with us, but they sat toward the back.  Keisha and I loved the movie, but more importantly, we loved spending the time together doing something we both love to do.  I really enjoy asking her about how her day at school was.  Having been to observe her class a few times, I was able to ask specific questions about different classmates and different activities.

He said if such a thing happens, we wouldn't be able to count on the support of France.   I told him that it didn't surprise me. Since we had come to France's rescue in World War I, World War II, Vietnam, and the Cold War, their ingratitude and jealousy was due to surface (again) at some point in the near future anyway. I also told him that is why France is a third-rate military power with a socialist economy and a bunch of pansies for soldiers. I additionally told him that America, being a nation of deeds and action, not words, would do whatever it had to do, and France's support, if it ever came, was only for show anyway. Just like in All NATO exercises, the US would shoulder 85% of the burden, and provide 85% of the support, as evidenced by the fact that this French officer was shopping in the American PX, and not the other way around.   He began to get belligerent at that point, and I told him if he would like to, I would meet him outside in front of the Burger King and whip his a** in front of the entire Multi-National Brigade East, thus demonstrating that even the smallest American had more fight than the average Frenchman.

"5602",5602,449628,"Aries","              Just Get Happy Already!   I was just visiting  urlLink damash , and had to  urlLink post a comment .  Here's an excerpt from his post: Just browsing round a few different 'Christian' blogs, there's one thing that stands out. Most people are not having the best of times. Why is that? Why are we never happy? Do you think it's all to do with your perspective? I do. Think about it. Christians should be the happiest people on earth. If you're a Christian, you have nothing to worry about! You know what your future will be. What you do day to day is important, yes, but what you do in eternity is infinitely more important. You should be able to live your life confidently and happily right now because you know where you'll be spending most of eternity. I might not have been reading his post in context, and it may be that it's 1:15 AM here in Dayton, Ohio USA, but I commented: Dave, I tend to agree with you, although not wholeheartedly. I think it is important to understand that no one can be 'UP' 100% of the time. Even Jesus had his moments of sorrow and grief. Some people, myself included, are more predisposed to depression and anxiety than others. God still commands us to be joyful always and not to worry, yet for many, it comes so easily.   Having mental illness is not something that I've been able to accept that easily. I've often felt, 'Hey! You're a Christian! Snap out of it, why don't you?' It's not that easy, and it's rather insensitive for someone to think that way.   I'm learning to accept that my mental illness is partly biological in nature, and, I need to do what I can to manage it, but I also need to accept that God still is with me, even during dark times.   I've also learned that you can have Joy despite the circumstances. THAT is where the perspective comes into play. Paul pleaded for the Lord to take away the thorn in his flesh, but Jesus said, 'My power is made perfect in weakness.' This caused Paul to rejoice in his weaknesses.   That's my two pence. There.

"5605",5605,449628,"Aries","              Dealing with Another's Pain   Acute otis media - that's the medical term for an acute ear infection.  Within the last 48 hours, Keisha has gotten earaches - one for each ear.  She has not been wearing her hearing aids, naturally, so we've been using sign language to communicate with her where needed.  We've wondered whether this is related to her getting her 6-year molars, since she describes pain from the back of her jaw to her ear, as though her 6-year molars were coming in.  Friday night we took her to Urgent Care at Children's Medical Center here in Dayton, and the doctor confirmed that she had an ear infection in her left ear.  Saturday morning Jennie took her to the pediatrician, who diagnosed an ear infection in the right ear as well.  When the pain is present, it exists as a constant hurting, and all she can do is moan in agony.  Fortunately we have her on Children's Tylenol and Motrin, along with the antibiotic Cefzil (insert respective trademarks where applicable).  She just isn't her normal self.  Jennie and I, in a way, appreciate times like these, in which we get to care for our lovely 5-1/2 year old baby girl, yet we also hurt, seeing her in pain.  I can personally relate to the pain that Keisha feels.  From the time I was born until I was about 7 years old, I would get ear infections at least once a year.  My most vivid memory is lying on the couch while my other siblings were around - Mom, too - moaning in agony because the pain was so acute, as I waited for my stepfather to return from the pharmacy with my medicine.  Yet there is someone else who can most definitely relate with the pain Keisha feels: Jesus Christ.  And God the Father can most definitely relate with the hurt I feel for Keisha.  God the Father watched his One and Only child suffer and die.  I praise you, Heavenly Father, for helping me to know you so much better as a result of the present situation with Keisha.  So Jennie and I are doing 'round-robin' duty tonight, which means that, as Keisha wakes up, we'll alternatively meet her needs.  I am so grateful to have a Father in Heaven who doesn't need sleep and who provides strength and peace.  He watches over us while we sleep.  It makes me wonder what he thinks about...         "

"5614",5614,449628,"Aries","              Living in a Winter Wasteland   Okay, that's probably over-exaggerating it a bit.  Maybe a lot.  I've actually had a great attitude about the wintery storm and the aftermath.  You could even say that I've had a great sense of humor.  We live in a cul de sac, which means that our section of the street is far down on the list when it comes to being plowed.  In fact, it was just yesterday, probably at the request of the Dayton Public Schools, that someone finally came and plowed our street, five days after the storm hit.  We've had some fun moments getting cars unstuck as we've turned into our street, which reminds me of a funny story that happened a few days ago.  Our driveway is on an incline, and, unless we keep it salted, it can be difficult, once we've taken the car out of the garage, to get it back up in the garage.  We've discovered that, if we come down the street at enough speed, we'll have enough momentum to take the car up the hill.  Naturally, there have been a few moments over the last couple of days that we've had to leave the car parked at the bottom of the driveway.  But it takes a lot for  me  to back down.  Well, maybe not that much.  On Monday I really wanted our car to get into the garage for some reason.  I probably didn't want to have to deal with scraping snow or ice off the car - something stupid and trivial like that.   Jennie had just come home from work and, after a brief struggle to get the car up the driveway, she parked it at the bottom.  Let me have a go at it, I thought.   'Man is the only animal that blushes -- or needs to.' --  urlLink Mark Twain    So, while she, Mom, and Keisha were inside the nice, warm house, I took up the gauntlet.  I hoppe in the car, put it in reverse and headed down to Hillcrest, the major road that is only about 500 feet from our house.  I turned right and head down a few blocks.  Noticing that there wasn't much traffic in either direction, I decided to pull a stunt.  I yanked the emergency brake and turned the car left so that it could spin around quickly, which it did.  Then, Mr. Stuntdriver, took off, heading back toward our street.  I paused to let oncoming traffic pass, and then I gunned it and made the left turn onto our snow/ice/slush-covered street, and the car immediately slid over, getting stuck on the side of the road.  No problem, I thought.  We only live 500 feet away, so I turned the car off and ran - if that's what you call trudging in winter boots and the slush/ice/snow mix - back home to get our shovel, hoping that Mom and Jennie didn't notice me.  Too late.  They'd already noticed me pulling the car away from the driveway moments before.  'No, I don't need any help.  I've got it under control.  Thanks!' Mr. Prideful said.  I 'ran' back to the car and began digging out around it.  A few minutes later, some neighbors drove by, and seeing the predicament I'd gotten myself into, got out to help.  I got in the car while they tried to push the car out of the way.  No luck at first.  Well, then, I look toward our house, and I see Jennie and Mom, now dressed up in their winter coats, heading my way.  Mom thought she was going to help push.  Yeah, right.  If there is a gene for pridefulness, I may have inherited it from her.  Mom, with fibro myalgia and other back problems.  Four foot eleven inches Mom.  I appreciated her heart and desire to help, but I didn't want her to jeopardize her own health in the process.  She made a good supervisor anyhow.  Jennie climbed into the car and, combined with our neigbors pushing and me wielding the snow shovel, she was able to drive the car out of where it was stuck.  Then she drove it back to the bottom of the driveway, where it was before.  It was good exercise and helped to relieve the boredom, though.         "

Tell brother Walt & Brother Elmer the Marine Corps beats working for old man Minch by a mile. Tell them to join up quick before maybe all of the places are filled.   I was restless at first because you got to stay in bed till nearly 6 a.m., but am getting so I like to sleep late. Tell Walt & Elmer all you do before breakfast is smooth your cot and shine some things. No hogs to slop, feed to pitch, mash to mix, wood to split, fire to lay. Practically nothing. Men got to shave but it is not so bad, they git warm water.   Breakfast is strong on trimmings like fruit juice, cereal, eggs, bacon, etc..., but kind of weak on chops, potatoes, ham, steak, fried eggplant, pie and other regular food. But tell Walt & Elmer you can always sit between two city boys that live on coffee. Their food plus yours holds you till noon, when you get fed again. It's no wonder these city boys can't walk much.   We go on 'route' marches, which the Platoon Seargent says are long walks to harden us. If he thinks so, it is not my place to tell him different. A 'route march' is about as far as to our mailbox at home. Then the city guys get sore feet, and we all ride back in trucks. The country is nice, but awful flat. The Seargent is like a schoolteacher. He nags some. The Capt. is like the school board. Majors & Colonels just ride around & frown. They don't bother you none. This next will kill Walt & Elmer with laughing.   I keep getting medals for shooting. I don't know why. The bulls-eye is near as big as a chipmunk and don't move. And it ain't shooting at you, like the Higgett boys at home. All you got to do is lie there all comfortable and hit it. You don't even load your own cartridges. They come in boxes. Be sure to tell Walt & Elmer to hurry & join before other fellers get into this setup & come stampeding in.   Your loving daughter, Gail   P.S. Speaking of shooting, enclosed is $200 towards a new barn roof & ma's teeth. The city boys shoot craps, but not very good.         "

"5624",5624,449628,"Aries","              No Contest   I recently received an email from an acquaintance who is in training as a truck driver.  He mentioned a close call he had as he was driving down a mountain highway.  He also advised to never, if you're involved in an accident, openly apologize to someone else, because that opens you up for a lawsuit.  I can tend to agree with that.  I was involved in a car accident in 2000.  It had been raining and I was following the car ahead of me too closely and rear-ended them.  I had received a ticket and had heard from  urlLink Clark Howard , a nationally-syndicated consumer advocate, whose show is broadcast on AM radio in our area, that even paying the traffic ticket in that case could be considered an admission of guilt and open myself up to a lawsuit.  I sought advice from a lawyer, who recommended that I go to court and plead 'No Contest'.  That way, if I was found guilty, I still wouldn't be openly admitting it.  Other than having to take some time off work, God really blessed me.  The judge wound up finding that I was guilty, but he let me off without having to pay a fine and even waived the court costs, provided that I never show up in his courtroom again.  So all I got were some points against my driver's license.  God even provided for us to be able to get financed for a slightly-used car.          "

I'll have to blog the story behind that some other time, but for now, let's just say that my life has been oh so different (much better) since then!  I fell in love with her and told her so for the first time on Memorial Day weekend 1993, and by October 1993, I was convinced that she was the one for me.  The rest is history, which also makes up for good content on blogs, by the way.          "
"5637",5637,449628,"Aries","              Blogging the Past   I'd like to do some more writing, but I feel a bit distracted by this sinus infection.  So I've taken to adding quotes to my  urlLink QuotesBlog .  This exercise has been interesting in that I've been going through old planner pages, since they had daily quotes on them.  In addition to culling the quotations, I'm also reading what I'd written for those particular days.  For instance, I'm currently travelling back in time to six years ago, 1997, the year that Keisha was born.  I'm amazed now, as I look back, that I was able to get anything done.  My job was totally overwhelming me, and, of course, we were getting ready for our new baby.  Here are some interesting items of note:   Monday, January 13, 1997:   Jennie has some stuff on her heart that she needs to talk to me about.  To work or not after the baby is born?  To work part-time during the rest of the pregnancy, if it's doctor's orders?  Will our insurance cover the cost of birthing classes?  Monday, January 20, 1997:   Jennie missed her bus and caught another one home.  On her way back from the bus stop, she slipped and fell, landing on her right hip.  Called doctor and waiting to hear back.  We got to bus stop late.  We left home late.  We weren't really ready for the morning.  Doctor called back - baby should be fine.  Jennie should take it easy and drink fluids.  Tuesday, January 21, 1997:   Mom and Paul separated.  Can't go into details right now.  Pray for them.  Her new number to come later.  Friday, January 24, 1997:   Mark (my boss at the time) told me that Materials Inventory due this coming Monday afternoon.  Convicted me about my time management.  Sunday, February 16, 1997:   Felt baby moving!  Heard it moving!  Thursday, February 20, 1997:   Stayed at work until 2 AM 2/21 working on SARA 312/RPCC inventory.  Friday, February 21, 1997:   Chris Hayes encouraged me.  Monday, February 24, 1997:   Learned that Rob and April had lost their baby  Sunday, March 2, 1997:   Ate dinner together with Dad, June, Jason, and Amber  Thursday, March 6, 1997:   Purchased baby swing, booster seat, and playpen from Beckie Roberts.  Saturday, March 8, 1997:   Met WHIO-AM late afternoon talk show host Kent Voss at the Baby Fair at Hara Arena.  Introduced myself as his 'Official Environmental Engineer.'  Wednesday, April 2, 1997:   Paid for bookcase and baby's dresser in full.  Thanks to Randy and Tony for helping out.  Thursday, April 3, 1997:   Jennie noticed some spotting.  I came home early from work.  Had ultrasound performed at Dayton Medical Imaging.  Got pictures.  Girl.  That's about as far as I've gotten.  I am so glad I recorded some of these things.  Especially now, since we're coming up on the 6-year anniversary of them happening.  Did you know that every six years the date is on the same day of the week?  It would be seven years if we didn't have a leap year somewhere in that period.  I wish I could express my feelings about reading through these memories.  The stuff going on at work would eventually lead to my separating from them in September 1997.  As of April 3, 1997, we could now officially call our baby Keisha.  I'm close to tears even now as I type this.  I've only included small bits that I'd recorded.  So many other things were recorded back then, that are important within the context of my life.  It definitely feels profound to me.         "

Yesterday, Jennie and I went to our old family doctor, and, since we don't have health insurance right now, paid for the office visits out of our own pocket: $51 each for the office visits, totaling $102.  Then we went to the pharmacist to get our prescriptions filled, again paying out of our own pocket: $181 for three prescriptions, two of which were not available in generic form.  Because my mom receives MedicAid for her medical stuff, her office visit and medicine didn't cost us any out-of-pocket money.  Nevertheless, I was a bit upset for having to pay so much for medical care, and I prayed on the way home for God to help me be grateful that we even had the money and access to the medical care.  I also prayed for the medicine to do its job.  Ultimately, God is in control, and I need to trust in him.  I guess that is one of the biggest things I am learning in my life:  that I need to concentrate on the stuff that I can handle and leave the rest up to God.  I encourage you to please pray for us, as these new circumstances just add to the strenuous ones we're already dealing with.         "

Police said Blaine fled with the stash while $100 bills were falling out of his pockets, and then he realized as he arrived at his getaway car that he had locked the keys inside. He grabbed a log to smash the window but tossed it away in frustration, only to have it hit Emmett Lowe's truck, thus angering Lowe, who grabbed a gun and chased Blaine for 150 yards. In a struggle, Blaine shot at Lowe but hit himself in the leg, just before Lowe shot Blaine in the same leg. [Washington Times, 1-17-03]         "
"5650",5650,449628,"Aries","              You Know It's 2003 When...   Your reason for not staying in touch with family is because they do not have e-mail. You have a list of 15 phone numbers to reach your family of three. Your grandmother asks you to send her a JPEG file of your newborn so she can create a screen saver. You pull up in your own driveway and use your cell phone to see if anyone is home. Every commercial on television has a web site address at the bottom of the screen. You buy a computer and 3 months later it's out of date and sells for half the price you paid. Leaving the house  without your cell phone, which you didn't have the first 20 or 30 (or 60) years of your life, is now a cause for panic and you turn around to go get it. Using real money, instead of credit or debit, to make a purchase would be a hassle and take planning. You just tried to enter your password on the microwave. You consider second-day air delivery painfully slow. Your dining room table is now your flat filing cabinet. Your idea of being organized is multiple-colored Post-it notes.

I'm not sure if you know what a CI involves, but I'll give you a little bit of info.  Basically, a surgeon drills a hole in Keisha's head and attaches an electrode to her auditory nerve.  Once that heals over, she then gets fitted with a magnet that attaches to her head an leads to a receiver in her ear.  The receiver looks a little like a hearing aid.  There's probably a website I could direct you to, but I don't have the link right now.  Please pray for us.

"5674",5674,449628,"Aries","              A Dream of Apocalyptic Proportions   I had one of the weirdest dreams last night.  It was very vivid.  It was about an Anthrax epidemic that occurred during Hitler's reign.  I got to follow it from the first strain, which was 'alien'.  Someone thought the particle/being/thing looked interesting, and they picked it up and got infected.  Moments later, a group of scientists head to this lab that has done most of the research on a vaccine.  The head of the American group had this disrespectful attitude toward this one other scientist from the research lab, who seemed to be 'mentally deficient' in some way.  This disrespectful scientist was questioning, almost ordering everyone, trying to find out what could be done about it.  Then this eccentric scientist revealed himself to the first one.  He had interviewed the first man for a job with this lab many years ago.  This eccentric man took the first one to a safe, opened it, and pulled out several vials.  'What are those?' the first one asked.  'Purity vials,' the other replied.  The first understood that they were pure vaccines that could be reproduced to give to others.   I guess I could apologize for this sounding so disjointed, but I just want this to get out before I forget it.   In my dream, when the flashback between the American doctor and the elder, more eccentric doctor, occurs, and the American doctor realizes that he had interviewed for a job with the other doctor, and interesting thing occurred.  As a gesture of his rejection, the elder doctor forcibly kissed the other on the lips, in a homosexual kind of way.  Really weird to me at the time.  So the doctor had just found the 'Purity vials'.   (BTW, this whole dream sounds like it could have been an 'X-Files' episode or something.)   Then, an explosion occurs, and everyone in the lab dies.  Except for me.  The vials... I cannot remember what happened to them.  I begin to wonder, 'Where is a good place to find refuge?'  Then I remember where I grew up:  Mt. Healthy.  Mount Healthy was where several people settled as a refuge from the cholera virus that had occurred in Cincinnati, Ohio a long time ago.  Mt. Healthy sounded like a great place to go.  I then remember heading into a stadium that would be a safe haven from the epidemic, but somehow, others that are infected find us, and I somehow get infected.  Then Hitler shows up for a rally.  All I can think about is to get close to this evil madman, so that I can somehow infect him, too.  And then I wake up.  Okay, all you readers out there.  Who wants to interpret the dream for me?  I have my own ideas, which I may post some other time.         "
"5675",5675,449628,"Aries","               urlLink Request for Prayer    from Rich Garner - Military Support Ministry - Friday, March 14, 2003  As moderator for the Military Support Ministry on UpCyberDown, I often get requests for contact information, church locations, and other tid bits that help our deployed brothers and sisters stay connected to the fellowship. But recently, my inbox has been swamped with a frightening amount of email... questions, concerns, pleas... regarding one haunting threat; war.  Several brothers have informed me of their deployment plans and have requested that I put them in touch with Christians in their deployment locations. Some have announced their support for the U.S. troops. Others have voiced concerns over Biblical implications of the situation in the Middle East region. But the one reason I felt compelled to write this is the need for prayers. Not only do I get prayer requests in my Military Support inbox, but also my church email and the message boards that I moderate.  Recently, a brother contacted me and asked that we get a prayer request out to all the churches around the world. After seeing miraculous repentance and efforts at unity within the International churches, I believe this is an attainable goal.  I realize that our military ministries are comprised of hundreds of different nations... but all of us will be affected in some way or another by the US led invasion of Iraq. Therefore, on behalf of all brothers and sisters in arms that are in harms way, faithful family and friends back home and concerned Christians everywhere, I am requesting a day of prayer on Sunday March 23th, 2003, from all churches that are able to read this message.   The goal is for each church to offer prayers and petitions to God for 24 hours beginning any time on Sunday March 23th, 2003. Each church would decide the best way to accomplish the goal.  (If some churches are reading this article after March 23th, be faithful that God will still hear your prayers on any day after that.)    The purpose of the prayer day is to ask God for three things:  Protection and safe return home (wherever home may be)  for everyone involved in the war, Wisdom, peace and faith that only Jesus can bring in times of war and Successful spread of His Word throughout the Middle East region. The Bible tells us that Jesus will not return until the Word of God has been preached to the entire world. Therefore I believe our prayers should focus on the Word of God being powerfully spread throughout the region and the baptism of everyone in those nations. Peace of mind and protection from harm should also be asked as well as increasing faith as we see God work miracles in a land of conflict.  So, I put this to every God-fearing, Christ-loving person who reads or hears this message. Let our voices unite in praise and worship and let us ask of our Father what He has promised us in John 14:13... 'And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father.'  And to God be the Glory, Rich Garner          "

Vectren is working diligently, through our customer contact center, our web site, bill inserts and the mass media, to help better explain how these factors are impacting our customers.

"5693",5693,449628,"Aries","              This Thing Is Real   This recent email comes from my friend and brother in Christ, Dave F., who is serving in the US Navy on an aircraft carrier during Operation Iraqi Freedom:  Hi!!  How is everything on the home front?  Reality came to some of us today. I can't go into detail on this, but as a stretcher carrier I saw things I wished I could unsee.  I did what I could to help out. When it was all over I went and sat on my rack and prayed for a bit. The cost of war is high but sometimes necessary. I just pray that God uses the outcome to further open the door for him to be introduced to the people. Otherwise the loss of life and worldly liberation of Iraq will be for naught. I'm also praying that what ever happens, for this to be short to keep the losses on both sides low. I am sorry this is not a happy email.   Outside of that things have been pretty normal. The Chiefs and some Officers were working in our galley today. It was kind of fun to watch. The food was better than normal.  I mentioned that to one chief and jokingly asked what we had to do to get them to continue working in our galley. My senior chief was working in the scullery (sink area).  I saw him at one point as he was pushing a cart full of plates lift himself up and ride it briefly like a kid does a shopping cart in a store. That was amusing and a good break from the day's earlier events.  I have to go now. What I did today was only a fraction of what could have been. When you think about us out here pray for those disciples who are ashore and going through this. They are in the thick of this and dealing with it on a more personal basis. In the meantime I am still praying for you and the Body.  I still see the changes you are going through as a time for strengthening.  'Rumor' has it we may see land sometime in the next few weeks. I can not specify when, but from everyone I have talked to, the date has been constant.  Hopefully we can meet then. I am not holding my breath on this, but please pray that it happens.  We were supposed to see land twice already but those plans got yanked.  Of all the ships that came out with us, ours and one other ship are the only ones that have not visited land.  I would so much like to visit the disciples here.  YBiC (Your Brother in Christ),  Dave          "

"5695",5695,449628,"Aries","              Pecans in the Cemetery   via email from Steve K.   On the outskirts of a small town, there was a big, old pecan tree just inside the cemetery fence.  One day, two boys filled up a bucketful of nuts and sat down by the tree, out of sight, and began dividing the nuts.  'One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me,' said one boy. Several dropped and rolled down toward the fence.  Another boy came riding along the road on his bicycle. As he passed, he thought he heard voices from inside the cemetery. He slowed down to investigate.  Sure enough, he heard, 'One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me.'  He just knew what it was. 'Oh my', he shuddered, 'it's Satan and the Lord dividing the souls at the cemetery.'   He jumped back on his bike and rode off.  Just around the bend he met an old man with a cane, hobbling along. Come here quick,' said the boy, 'you won't believe what I heard!  Satan and the Lord are down at the cemetery dividing up the souls.'  The man said, 'Beat it kid, can't you see it's hard for me to walk.'   When the boy insisted though, the man hobbled to the cemetery. Standing by the fence they heard, 'One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me...'  The old man whispered, 'Boy, you've been tellin' the truth. Let's see if we can see the Lord himself.'  Shaking with fear, they peered through the fence, yet were still unable to see anything. The old man and the boy gripped the wrought iron bars of the fence tighter and tighter as they tried to get a glimpse of the Lord.   At last they heard, 'One for you, one for me.'  And one last 'One for you, one for me. That's all.  Now let's go get those nuts by the fence, and we'll be done.'  They say the old man made it back to town a full 5 minutes ahead of the boy on the bike.         "

"5708",5708,449628,"Aries","              U.N. Inspection Teams    This tongue-in-cheeck report comes via email from Dave F., who is serving in Operation Enduring Freedom:  Have you noticed anything fishy about the inspection teams who have arrived in Iraq?  They're all men!   How in the name of the United Nations does anyone expect  men  to find Saddam's stash? We all know that men have a blind spot when it comes to finding things. For crying' out loud!  Men can't find the dirty clothes hamper. Men can't find the jar of jelly until it falls out of the cupboard and splatters on the floor.... and these are the people we have sent into Iraq to search for hidden weapons of mass destruction?  I keep wondering why groups of  mothers  weren't sent in. Mothers can sniff out secrets quicker than a drug dog can find a gram of dope. Mothers can find gin bottles that dads have stashed in the attic beneath the rafters. They can sniff out a diary two rooms and one floor away. They can tell when the lid of a cookie jar has been disturbed and notice when a quarter inch slice has been shaved off a chocolate cake. A mother can smell alcohol on your breath before you get your key in the front door and can smell cigarette smoke from a block away. By examining laundry, a mother knows more about their kids than Sherlock Holmes. And if a mother wants an answer to question, she can read an offenders eyes quicker than a homicide detective.  So... considering the value a mother could bring to an inspection team, why are we sending a bunch of old men who will rely on electronic equipment to scout out hidden threats? My mother would walk in with a wooden soup spoon in one hand, grab Saddam by the ear, give it a good twist and snap,'Young man, do you have any weapons of mass destruction?'  And God help him if he tried to lie to her. She'd march him down the street to some secret bunker and shove his nose into a nuclear bomb and say, 'Uh, huh, and what do you call this, mister?' Whap! Thump! Whap! Whap! Whap! And she'd lay some stripes across his bare bottom with that soup spoon, then march him home in front of the whole of Baghdad. He'd not only come clean and apologize for lying about it, he'd cut every lawn in Baghdad for free for the whole dang  summer.  Inspectors my foot ... You want the job done?  Call my mother.

"5733",5733,449628,"Aries","              'McCustomer No-Service' Rant   They say, 'We Love to See You Smile,' but today they didn't even try.  Today's rant comes courtesy of none other than  urlLink McDonald's .  Specifically, I'm talking about the operation located at  urlLink 4770 N. MAIN ST., DAYTON, OH 45405-5021 , located next to the Blockbuster Video store.  I have had to leave the following  urlLink complaint at their website : You say 'We Love to See You Smile.'  I must disagree, based on my experience.  All I wanted to do was compare the prices for the soft drinks.  Your menus have gotten so cluttered that the prices and sizes for soft drinks were not listed.  I asked the drive thru attendant what the prices were, and she was most uncooperative.  Downright rude, actually.  She stated that she didn't know.  She did not take any initiative to find out from any management that were present.  The situation deteriorated to the point where I stated, 'Thank you for your 'Customer No-Service'.  I'll take my business elsewhere.'  I returned minutes later to get complaint information, but that was hard to come by as well.  The drive thru attendants didn't know the information, and they were not very willing to find it out.  I happened to see a crew leader (wearing a light blue shirt) and asked him.  He gave me the information.  I told the attendants, 'See?  All you have to do is ask one of your managers.  It's not THAT hard to do, is it?'  It was obvious to me that to McDonald's, I am just another customer number, just a dollar amount.  Shoo me in, and shoo me out.  'We Love to See You Smile' is your slogan.  You didn't make me smile today.    What are you going to do about this?  You may not even do anything about my complaint.  Well, you may find that I don't visit this McDonalds again.  You also may find that my friends won't either, because I have begun to tell my friends about this experience.  And, of course, a business that continues to operate in this manner does not have a big chance of surviving in the long run.  I now leave this in your hands.

I was a little bit surprised to find the Amazon.com link for the book.  One thing to note about this book, and, I suppose any book, for that matter, is the context in which it is written.  My copy is the second printing, which occurred in 1989, so some of the examples used may appear a little (or a lot) dated.

"5751",5751,449628,"Aries","              Friends in the Fight for Enduring Freedom   Last Thursday I learned that another of our close friends, who serves in the Army Reserves, will likely be sent out very soon.  We learned this from his wife; they have two kids.  She mentioned that it will likely be a 12-month stint, which means that she will, for all intents and purposes, become a single mom during that time.  I am blessed to receive email rather regularly from another friend, Dave F., who is stationed somewhere in the Atlantic.  In his recent email, he writes: Yesterday we picked up all of our misdirected mail.  There was 7 tons that were sent to the wrong location.  I got one small package that made me very happy.  For everyone it was like a visit from Santa.  A lot of people received and shared  brownies and cookies.  I'm sure they were fresh when they were baked but it took so long that most of it was dry when it got here.  We didn't care one bit though and thought they tasted great.  I guess it was just knowing that they came from home. It's was encouraging to see the sharing.  I am told they are still sorting through the mail.  When I first left I packed a few  urlLink DPI  books, the disciples handbook and the song book. I packed the song book hoping to go to a church service out here.  My song book has stayed in my sea bag through out the whole trip until today. For what ever reason I felt the urge to dig it out today.   People who know me, know I don't sing by myself. I jokingly live by the motto 'The Bible says make a joyful noise so I keep my mouth shut' ;)  There I was with my song book looking over some of my favorite songs and just began singing some of them to myself. For those moments I felt 2 things. I had a strong feeling of peace that was with me and second, I felt like I was standing there with the Body. I can't describe it beyond that but it was great.  I have to go. I thought I would share some of this encouragement with you.  Thank you for the email and most importantly your prayers. They have helped me so much to stay in the fight. I thought we were going to visit a port with disciples but that was changed. That was the reason we had the steel beach BBQ. I would have traded one hour with disciples over the day of recreation.

"5765",5765,449628,"Aries","              Bunny Babies   You might say that the Easter bunny left us a couple of his relatives.  This past Friday morning Jennie spotted two baby rabbits in one of the window wells outside our house.  (For those that don't know what a window well is, I'll explain.  Our basement is below grade, yet we also have some windows to let light in.  Outside our home, surrounding these windows is a semi-circular cutout of the ground around the window, with some metal present to retain the soil.)  At the time we had wondered if the mother rabbit had placed them there for their safety.  Jennie called the local Humane Society and the Natural History Museum for some advice.  The folks at the museum recommended leaving them alone for a few days to see if they get out by themselves.  If, after that time, they are still in the window well, we should get them out ourselves.  So, we had friendly wildlife just outside our home this weekend.  Tonight I went to see how they were doing and to get them out of the window well.  Alas, one of the rabbits had died.  I purloined my daughter's butterfly net and pulled both of them out.  The dead rabbit I threw into our garbage can, to be taken to the landfill with our other trash tomorrow morning.  The live one I placed in our yard at about five feet away from the window well.  About an hour later, I went back outside to check on the little guy.  He was gone.         "

"5769",5769,449628,"Aries","              It's Scary Down There!   One thing I am definitely afraid of, to the point where I dread having to deal with it myself -- so much so that I shudder -- is looking for something in my wife's purse.  It's like a black hole down there!  There have been some times that I have mistakenly, and with immediate regret, forgotten this and have gone searching for something inside there.  Usually I've been looking for something, and my wife tells me that it's in her purse.  How badly I want whatever it is that I'm looking for is in direct proportion to the level of effort I take in looking inside my wife's purse.  And the extent.  For example, I remember dumping my wife's purse out when somebody came to our house to get their car keys back.   urlLink Jennie  was not happy about that.  As if there was some sort of order to it anyway! (just kidding, honey!)  Tonight when she was going through her purse she found a vital part to Keisha's FM system:  the receivers, which attach to her  urlLink hearing aids .  For those who don't know what I'm talking about, I'll provide a brief explanation.  By wearing hearing aids, Keisha gets amplified sounds, targeted to the specific type of hearing loss she has.  With this setup, however, she hears not only sounds she wants to hear, but also other environmental sounds as well.  Have you ever hooked up headphones to a tape recorder and listened while you record?  You hear not only what you're trying to record, but the sound of the refrigerator, feet squeaking on the floor, and so on.  The  urlLink FM system  provides a way for Keisha to hear sounds specifically targeted to her.  When we wear it, and she has the receivers on her hearing aids, she can hear us better over the other sounds.  It's been months since we've used the FM system, and I'm glad Jennie was the one to go through her purse to find them.  Now, if we can only find my keys.         "

'Just an updated picture, among other things.'  'To verify that the property is being occupied, for example,' I added.  I took the dog for a walk, as this individual drove to the end of our cul de sac, turned around, parked for a little while, and then began to head out.  I approached the vehicle and asked this individual, 'How does someone get a job like yours?  Seriously.  I'm unemployed and looking for work.'  'Well, I don't know.

I explained, in my best 5-year old language that I could, what the folks at the E-check station were going to do.  Then we got to watch.  Fortunately, our 1997 Honda Civic passed the emissions test, and, after bloodletting the $19.50 we took our certificate and headed for the  urlLink Bureau of Motor Vehicles(BMV)  so that I could get my driver's license and our car's registration renewed.

We walked inside and pulled a number from the 'Take a Number' machine (for lack of a better description).  I asked Keisha to confirm the number: 'B09.'  We sat down on one of the benches and waited, as the employees of the BMV called out numbers.  'Daddy, wanna play Barbies?' Keisha asked.  'No, sweetheart, I don't.  Thank you, though.  You really should bring the Ken doll if you want me to play,' I replied.  Keisha played by herself and looked around.  She saw an obese man across the room and told me about it.  'That man has a big belly, Daddy,' she said.  'Yeah, well, people come in all sizes and types, sweetheart,' I said.  'Some people are big; others are little.  Some people are young, and others are old.'  'Like those people,' she said looking across the aisle from us at the gray-haired couple.  'Yes, like those people,' I said.    Finally, someone from the BMV called out, 'Number 9!'  I got up and went to the counter, handing over my driver's license and registration info.  'We need to do an eye exam, and we'll need you to remove your glasses first.'  'But I can't see anything without them,' I protested.  'Let's try it without them first, and then we'll try it with them on,' the lady said.  After asking me to read a certain line, I told her that all I saw was a blur.  So she let me use my glasses.  I passed the eye exam and went on to get my picture taken.  Next to the place where you sit are some comic strips about getting your driver's license picture taken and a mirror.  I sat down and smiled.  She took my picture.  Moments later, after I had certified that I have insurance and no medical condition that would keep me from piloting the space shuttle, it was time to pay the fee.  I made out a check to 'State of Ohio BMV' for $50 (:-O more bloodletting).  I then asked the lady if she'd need to see my driver's license, since I was writing a check.  'No, we know how to find you if there's a problem.'  Comforting.  Indeed.  After telling Keisha that she couldn't get  her  picture taken and to stay away from the eye exam machine, the lady handed me my new driver's license and registration information.  Keisha and I walked back to the car, and I affixed the new sticker to our license plate.  All this done 11 days early!  That's different for me.  Now... where is that  tax information ?         "

"5816",5816,449628,"Aries","              Another Email from the Gulf...   I've received another email from a good friend serving not only in the US Navy in Operation Iraqi Freedom, but also most importantly God Almighty.  He writes: Hey, Hey!!  How is everything for you back there?  Things were a little rough for me the past couple weeks but I'm praying and working through it.  There have been a lot of rumors going around as to when we might come home.  During the Captain's inspection of our department she was asked to clarify the rumor for us. She did not give us a date but did tell us which rumor was closest.  Sorry, I'm not at liberty to mention even that right now.  We still have not seen port yet. That is frustrating. We thought we were going to very soon but that too looks like it won't happen for us. Yesterday most of of ship had a day off. There was a volleyball tournament in the hanger bay. It would have been a safe place had they not left the hanger bay doors open. We heard 'Willlsonnn!!!' (from Tom Hank's movie  urlLink  Cast Away  ) called out over the ship's intercom (we call it the 1MC) as we watched the volleyball go sailing through the hanger bay doors. Alas the SAR (Search And Resue) Swimmers were unavailable for the rescue. I hope that's not the case if we lose one of us ;) Maybe the ball will make it ashore and some kids will be able to enjoy it.  About your prayer for the war. I do not claim to know the heart of God or his mind, but this is my view on the war so far. I know many of you have been praying for a swift victory and few casualties. As in the days of the Old Testament, when God threw our enemies into confusion, he has seemed to protect us again. Yes we have had casualties but they have been very few compared to what could have been. We are finding Iraqi armor completely abandoned. We have literally captured groups of soldiers as they sleep (in the day time) and we took the Bagdad airport by surprise and with little resistance.  Even the Iraqi casualties, though large, could be even greater than they are. Through all of this many of their civilians have expressed great gratitude upon our arrival. The Iraqis do want liberation. They will probably want to hold on to their muslim beliefs but this liberation and freedom will make it easier for disciples [of Jesus Christ] to go in. This appears to be a ripe time for God to harvest. I'm just trying to offer some perspective on my view of the war. I hope this helps to build your faith in your prayers for the outcome of this.  Remember, as much you think about us over here, we are thinking about you back home :)  YBiC [Your Brother in Christ],  Dave          "

Many distractions frequently cause bedtime to become a nightly battle.  TV, video games, unfinished homework, etc., all interfere with bedtime.  Establishing a bedtime routine that is used nightly including weekends and holidays is helpful.  Some tips from the National Institute of Health include  Set a regular bedtime AND stick to it Establish a relaxing routine, such as reading a book or taking a warm bath Make after-dinner playtime relaxing Avoid eating a big meal close to bedtime, but do include a healthy snack before toothbrushing, especially if dinner is early A dark room is best but your child may do better with a soft nightlight The bedroom temperature should be at a comfortable level Making the decision to set an early bedtime for your young child and enforcing it has benefits.  First, it is part of establishing a schedule to help your child to be prepared for what comes next.

"5837",5837,449628,"Aries","              This is not a love song   Hi.  It seems that lately I've posted with a bit of a sense of humor, irregardless of what the subject is.  This might not be one of those kind of posts.  I'm feeling a bit down right now, to tell you the truth.  I'm close to tears.  Before I explain, I'll admit that, based on the tone of previous posts, it may be hard to take seriously.  Some who read it may laugh or think it's funny.  It may be parodied, even by me someday, I suppose.  I accept that.  I'm still willing to make myself vulnerable.  This is still a Journey Inside My Mind.  I may often, through my writing here, give an impression that I have it all together, that all is well with me emotionally, physically, spiritually, etc.  Well, that's not really the case.  I am dependent on medicine for my mental health.  I'm currently taking an antidepressant, Lexapro, and an anti-anxiety medicine, generically called Diazepam.  I struggle with depression and anxiety, you see.  Furthermore, I've written before about my struggles with self-injury.  That is exactly what it sounds like.  Many people don't know how to relate with someone who self-injures.  Even seeing the words, I feel a slight sense of alarm myself.  Yet it's true.  I create scabs on my body and pick at them to relieve anxiety I feel.  I've done some research, and I realize that it's a way I've developed to cope with stress I feel.  I know it sounds counterproductive, but it makes sense, from a certain point of view.  I get a 'rush' from the pain felt from picking at a scab.  The pain associated with that activity is better to feel than emotional pain I feel from something else.  I've done this since I was about 7 years old.  I'm 33 now.  I currently have four scabs on my scalp.  I feel their tenderness as I type these words.  I've been able to leave them alone nearly all day, thankfully.  So I have that to deal with.  Then, today, it appears that I've developed another migraine.  I took my last Imitrex a few hours ago, and I've put a call into my doctor for a refill.  I have to wait until 6 PM to see if someone actually called it into the pharmacy.  Because it's a Saturday afternoon, I'm thinking that it might not be called in until Monday.  I'm hoping that's not the case, but, at the same time, I'm trying to be prepared to accept it, if it turns out to be the case.  I've already spent a few extra hours in bed, and I'm ready to head back there in a little while.  I doubt if anyone really enjoys feeling sick.  I sure don't.  Tears are welling in my eyes right now.  I just hope things feel better soon.  Until then...         "

We had 5 people packed into a Dodge Neon... cozy, but fun.  It was supposed to rain all weekend, but God heard the prayers.  Saturday, there wasn't a cloud in the sky, and it didn't rain Sunday either.  It was really nice to get away and hang with some old friends. I also met some neat brothers from Charlotte, North Carolina, that weren't in the church there when I was living in the Queen City  [note from Dan: I think he's referring to Charlotte, although I've most often heard of Cincinnati, Ohio referred to as the Queen City!] .  Our group was blown away. That was the first time they had been to any conference outside of Ohio. They finally got to see a glimpse of what I had been telling them the God's church is really like. My old church where I was converted (Charlotte) had 60 people attend. Wow! Our group was impressed by that alone. There were nearly 500 disciples there. It was amazing.  The trip has motivated us (especially me) to stop waiting for someone else to plan activities for us as the singles group. We are talking about having a 'movie night' every month and planning on doing a different activity every month on top of that. We need to be creative, and for the longest time, we haven't really had anything going on.  Nothing to invite people to except for church.  Nevertheless, it was a great impactful time in so many ways. We have a plan, bro... something about momentum that is infectious.  We had 5 people go this year to Beachstock.

"5859",5859,449628,"Aries","              Support    via email from my friend and brother Bill T.  I think the only reason why I'm posting this here is because it's so ridiculous.   Take a minute to enjoy a laugh...  ... for little Billy Evans.  I am a very sick little boy. My mother is typing this for me, because I can't. She is crying. Don't cry, Mommy! Mommy is always sad, but she says it's not my fault. I asked her if it was God's fault, but she didn't answer and only started crying harder, so I don't ask her that anymore. The reason she is so sad is because I'm so sick. I was born without a body. It doesn't hurt, except when I try to breathe. The doctors gave me an artificial body.  It is a burlap bag filled with leaves. The doctors said that was the best they could do on account of us having no money or insurance. I would like to have a body transplant, but we need more money. Mommy doesn't work because she said nobody hires crying people.  I said, 'Don't cry, Mommy,' and she hugged my burlap bag. Mommy always gives me hugs, even though she's allergic to burlap and it makes her sneeze and chafes her real bad. I hope you will help me. You can help me if you forward this email to everyone you know. Forward it to people you don't know, too. Dr. Johansen said that for every person you forward this email to, Bill Gates will team up with AOL and send a nickel to NASA. With that funding, NASA will collect prayers from school children all over America and have the astronauts take them up into space so that the angels can hear them better. Then they will come back to earth and go to the Pope, and he will take up a collection in church and send all the money to the doctors.  The doctors could help me get better then.  Maybe one day I will be able to play baseball. Right now I can only be third base.  Every time you forward this letter, the astronauts can take another prayer to the angels and my dream will be closer to coming true. Please help me.  Mommy is so sad, and I want a body. I don't want my leaves to rot before I turn 10.  If you don't forward this email, that's okay. Mommy says you're mean and heartless. One who doesn't care about a poor little boy with only a head.  She says that if you don't stew in the raw pit of your own guilt-ridden stomach, she hopes you die a long, slow, horrible death and then burn forever in hell. What kind of cruel person are you that you can't take five freakin' minutes to forward this to all your friends so that they can feel guilt and shame about ignoring a poor, bodiless nine-year-old boy?  Please help me. I try to be happy, but it's hard. I wish I had a kitty.  I wish I could hold a kitty. I wish I could hold a kitty that wouldn't chew on me and try to bury its poop in the leaves of my burlap body. I wish that very much.  Thank You, Billy 'Smiles' Evans (the boy with just a head, and a burlap sack for a body)         "

As you may recall, I had to completely redo it.  This meant rerunning it through the  urlLink Blogmatrix Template Rewriter  again.  Once I did all of this, I noticed, after a few days, that the RSS feeds were not being generated/updated.  I've realized that I had added some formatting to the metadata tags that the Template Rewriter added, and this formatting may be what is causing the problems with the RSS feed.  So last night I removed the extra formatting and republished the blog.  I just returned to the template HTML that is stored on  urlLink Blogger , only to find that the previous template -- with the old layout -- is present!  Fortunately, I saved a copy of my new template in case I needed to revise it or, in this case republish it.  But, when I copy, paste, save, republish, and return to check it, guess what?

"5862",5862,449628,"Aries","              Road Trip!   Today my lovely wife Jennie, our daughter Keisha, and her two friends Hailie and Stevie -- we all travelled to Columbus, Ohio for the day.  We had an all-Ohio church service along the banks of the Scioto River, at Genoa Park.  This location also was adjacent to  urlLink COSI .  The service itself was great.  Doug Jacoby preached a sermon about the Seven Unities of the Faith, based on what we read in  urlLink Ephesians 4 .  The main point was this:  if we don't know what we are about as a church, then we're in big trouble.  After the service, we went to COSI.  Our membership at  urlLink Dayton's Boonshoft Museum of Discovery  is reciprocated at the Columbus COSI, so we didn't have to pay any admission fee.  We then proceeded to the Atomic Cafe for some lunch.  After lunch we headed toward the exhibits.  It was all Jennie and I could do to keep up with the girls, who are collectively between the ages of 4 and 6.  Between the frequent potty breaks -- all the girls had to go with Jennie, and I went alone to the men's room -- and trying to keep our eyes on them as they experienced each of the various stations at the exhibits, Jennie and I got worn out.  We went to this one exhibit entitled  urlLink Crashendo , in which we rode in a vehicle and watched a movie that simulated us riding behind a man who was 'driving' a piano.  It was hilarious!  You had to have been there.  Like the  urlLink COSI in Toledo , it has a cycle ride across a wire.  The difference is that Columbus has a unicycle whereas Toledo has a bicycle.  I got to ride it, and I must have looked so brave to my daughter and her friends!  We also toured the Planetarium, in which there was a program about what we're seeing in the  urlLink Springtime night sky .  That was pretty cool.  Outside Keisha and Stevie went on a  urlLink Centripetal Generotor ride .  As we stood against the wall, the machine spun around at 17 miles per hour.  Inertia and friction kept us pinned to the wall, even as the floor dropped two feet.  It felt like an elephant was sitting on me.  Then, as the ride slowed down, we all slid the two feet back to the floor.  Stevie and Keisha, myself, too, enjoyed the ride so much that we returned three more times!  Jennie and Hailie didn't want to ride it.  They opted instead to play with the  urlLink Big Giant Lever , in which they attempted to lift an automobile with a level.  There were so many other exhibit stuff, and I'll have to post about it another time.  Jennie and I learned that we probably could have gone to the  urlLink little Kidspace  and stayed there.  It was the last exhibit we attended, however.  On the way home we stopped at the  urlLink Waffle House  for dinner.  I had their hashbrowns ('Scattered, Smothered, etc.'), Stevie had a grilled cheese sandwich, Keisha had her cheeseburger, and Jennie and Hailie had breakfast.  We sat in the five seats at their bar.  The girls were really impressed as they saw the kitchen area.  Keisha told one of the servers that she thought it was cool.  We later talked about having our home kitchen set up like theirs.  Keisha decided that she would man the drinks and the toasters.  Learn more about the Waffle House story and some interesting Waffle House facts  urlLink here .  It's interesting to see how these kids can behave like siblings.  Granted, Halie and Stevie  are  sisters.  But for Keisha and the rest of us, it creates a great dynamic.  For four days Keisha has two sisters living with her whereas she normally is the only child.  The adults in our household are realizing how much we appreciate how quieter the house is.  I love these two extra girls as though they are my own, and we have really enjoyed having them with us.         "

"5870",5870,449628,"Aries","              Living in the Estrogen Ocean   This weekend we have two extra girls staying with us.  They are 6 and 5 years old.  Our daughter Keisha is almost 6 years old.  In one sense, it's great that they are all so close in age.  In another, it's like having three of Keisha in the home.  They all three behave just like they're sisters.  Well, Hailie and Stevie  are  sisters, but Keisha gets in there and mixes it up with them just fine.  Thursday night was the first night they spent the night.  Keisha, being an only child, is not used to having other kids here.  The other girls needed to get used to being at our house as well.  Nevertheless, we needed them to get to bed because Hailie had school on Friday.  They didn't settle down that easily, and, as a result I had to bring out Mr. Justice.  Mr. Justice is the name we've given to a ping pong paddle that we use to spank.  After a few sessions of administering Mr. Justice, the girls finally understood that we were serious about them getting to bed.  I don't know whether Hailie and Stevie's mother spanks them that often, but, when they received Mr. Justice from me, I could tell there was a little bit of shock.  I had to tell them it was okay to cry, and they did.  Another reason why it's good to have the girls over is that Keisha gets to play and watch her 'girly' movies (like 'Life-Size', 'Snow White', and so on) with her friends.  I, being the only human male, tend to want to take our male dog and go camping or something like that.  For now, I'll settle for the online experience.

"5902",5902,449628,"Aries","              Sinuses, allergies, or was it too much Mother's Day?   Hi.  I'm not feeling too good today.  I think it actually started yesterday afternoon.  We came home from church and I laid down on the couch for a nap.  A few hours later I awoke with a splitting headache, where the upper left-hand corner of my left eye was the epicenter.  I made my way downstairs and took a Sinus/Allergy pill and laid down on our bed.  I reawoke at 4:30 PM to take  urlLink my mom  and  urlLink Jennie  to dinner for Mother's Day ( urlLink I actually alluded that something like this would happen late last week. ).  We initially tried to get into  urlLink Golden Corral  to take advantage of their All-You-Can-Eat Steak Buffet, but, alas, there were lines extending outside that showed how busy the restaurant was.  We decided instead to go to  urlLink Skyline Chili .  My mom, who grew up in Cincinnati, the birthplace of Skyline Chili, did not have it available to her as much when she lived in Texas.  Yet another good reason for her to move back to Ohio. :D  I barely had any appetite, but I somehow managed to eat a small 3-way and a cheese coney.  I guess there are some things that even sickness can't overcome, huh?  I went home took all my medicine and went to bed.  This was at about 6:30 PM last night.  I woke up this morning, and I felt a little better... until I coughed.  So I just took another dose of the sinus/allergy medicine, and I'm going to head back to bed for a little while.  The hot shower didn't seem to help a whole lot.  Except, maybe, that I feel sick and smell clean and fresh at the same time!         "
"5903",5903,449628,"Aries","              They sent us to our basement   This afternoon it rained hard.  We had a big thunderstorm come through.  I was brought to my senses when I heard the hail hitting our roof and looked out the window to see it streaming across the yard.  I walked to our covered porch to see how big the hail was.  At one point, I picked up a golf ball-sized piece.  Of course at that time, the local weathermen told us we needed to get to our basements because they had noticed some rotation in the cloud system, even though no funnels were created.  Just to be safe.  So we all went downstairs and sat on our bed and watched the progress of the thunderstorm on the local television station.  When it looked and sounded like the worst had passed I walked upstairs and outside to survey the area.  I called for everyone else to come up, too.  We saw lots of hail strewn around our yard, and it appears that the hood of mom's car was pelted with hail.  Other than that, everything looked okay.  Keisha walked around the yard, collecting pieces of hail in a plastic cup.  Then we all returned inside to the rest of our lives.         "

It's amazing that he can urinate in so many places; I wonder how he does it.  Does he have a second bladder?  I've also learned that I have to carry three plastic bags when we go on this walk.  When we came home, I knew that Jake needed a bath.  So Keisha and I got into our swimming suits and gave him a bath outside on our driveway.  He initially resisted the ordeal but gradually let what had to be done be done.  Only after we'd dried him off with a towel did Jennie allow him to return inside.

BTW, I got this from  urlLink mom , who picked this up via email, too.  The moral of this story: Always take time to explain.  REMEMBER THIS COULD BE YOU!  My mother taught me to read when I was four years old (the first mistake).  One day I was in the bathroom and noticed one of the cabinet doors was ajar.  I read the box in the cabinet, I then asked my mother why she kept napkins in the bathroom. Didn't they belong in the kitchen?  Not wanting to burden me with unnecessary facts, she told me that those were for 'SPECIAL OCCASIONS'.  Now fast forward a few months.   It's Thanksgiving day and my folks were leaving to pick up the pastor and his wife for dinner.  Mom had assignments for all of us while they were gone.  Mine was to set the table.  When they returned, the pastor came in first and immediately burst into laughter.  Next came his wife who gasped, the began giggling.   Next came my father, who roared with laughter!  Then came Mom who almost died of embarrassment when she saw each place setting on the table with A 'SPECIAL OCCASIONS' napkin at each plate, with the fork carefully arranged on top.  I had even tucked the little tail in so they didn't hang off the edge.  My mother asked me why I used these and, of course, my response sent the other adults into further fits of laughter.  'But Mom, you SAID they were for special occasions!!!'  Take time to laugh, it's the music of the soul. A merry heart doeth good like a medicine, but a broken spirit dirt the bones .

My wife Jennie and my daughter Keisha, on the other hand, have not.  Tuesday morning Jennie and Keisha slept in.  Keisha stayed home from school because she had been up all night, complaining from a 'scratchy throat'.  Jennie was feeling poorly, too.  Since she was a kid, Jennie has been prone to getting bronchitis.  Keisha was feeling better throughout the day and wound up going to school on Wednesday.  On Wednesday, Jennie called our family doctor and scheduled an appointment.  A few minutes later, she asked me what time her appointment was -- she was so 'out of it' that she'd forgotten that she'd made the appointment.  I was getting ready to go to a job fair at the Dayton Job Center, so mom asked Jennie if she felt well enough to drive herself.  Jennie asked mom if she would drive her.  I returned home from the job fair at the same time mom and Jennie returned.  Yesterday we went to Meijer to fill another prescription, and I saw the store brand for some sinus/allergy/pain relief medicine.  I bought for myself, because I've been feeling some of the early symptoms.  After we got home, I took the medicine and a nap.  I initially planned for it to only last until Keisha came home from school.  I woke up later when Jennie called me for dinner.  It wound up being a long nap then.  Now it's Friday morning, and Jennie, while feeling a little better from alternating pain relievers, is still experiencing symptoms.

"5938",5938,449628,"Aries","              Camping with the Men   I went camping this past Saturday with some of the men from church to Hueston Woods.  It's located near Miami University of Oxford, Ohio.  I think the last time I went camping was when I was in college, which was a long time ago.  One of the brothers from church has a tent that can sleep 10 people.  On Saturday night it slept 6 of us.  I was rudely reminded that ground is nothing like the mattress I have at home.  We had a great time Saturday night, playing cards, eating food we'd grilled out, sitting by the little bonfire we'd made.  Our campsite was adjacent to the lake, so we could look out over it as darkness fell.  The fireflies lit up the sky as if there were thousands of camera flashes going off.  It was beautiful, and I prayed with a few of the men.  I really needed to spend some time like this with some of the men from church, forging closer friendships.  It was also great on Sunday morning to go for a quiet walk.  I walked a little ways to a hill.  I sat down and wrote a little bit in my observation notebook, which I've entitled 'Sights and Sounds.'  I opened my Bible to Psalm 126, and, after reading it, sang a song we sometimes sing at church that is based on it, entitled 'Men Who Dream.'  I belted it out without inhibitions.  Then I sang some more songs to God and headed back to the campsite.  We had church with our little group of men.  If you've ever seen the movie 'Glory,' you may recall the scene before the troops went into battle.  The men alternatively prayed while the others hummed in the background.  We prayed like that.  It was moving, emotional, and inspiring.  Then Derek, our minister, gave a message about 'Salt and Light,' based on two of Jesus' famous parables.  Charles, a deaf brother, was one of the brothers who was on the trip.  It was so encouraging to see everyone communicating with him, and to see him trying to communicate with others.  He really has a great friendship with Davon, which overflowed to some humorous moments.  On Saturday evening, Davon, Charles, and some others went for a little hike.  A bit later, Mike decided to sneak up on them.  Davon saw and heard Mike coming, but Charles, of course, didn't hear it.  He loves Davon so much that at one occasion, he turned to Davon, while Mike is approaching them, and said, 'My man, Davon!' as Davon was telling him to hurry up and hide from Mike.  Later as we were trying to sleep in our tent, more humor erupted.  Any time Charles would sense that something was going on, he'd turn on his flashlight and shine it around everybody to see who was talking to him.  Of course as I write this I am aware that I'm not fully explaining it so that you can appreciate the humor.  This may be a case of 'you had to be there.'  Nevertheless, it was a great camping trip.         "

"5955",5955,449628,"Aries","              You Can't Take Me Clothes Shopping   I don't go clothes shopping often.  It shows.  I don't care.  Being married has meant that my wife helps pick out clothes for me.  I don't like spending money on myself for clothes.  I have a big problem with that.  I'm not that good at it, and I can think of a lot of other things I'd rather do.  As  urlLink I mentioned earlier , Jennie packed up a lot of my clothes and we donated them to Goodwill.  This, of course, meant that I needed some new threads.  Jennie, before heading to work this morning, mentioned that Wal*Mart is a good place.  I agreed, but I wasn't that hip to going clothes shopping all by myself.  At about 11 AM this morning, I mentioned to my mom that I was considering grabbing some lunch and heading to Wal*Mart.  I promoted the idea to Keisha by saying that we could look in the toy department at stuff she might want for her birthday.  Mom wasn't feeling that well, so it would have to be just Keisha and I for the trip.  We wound up doing what I mentioned earlier, instead (see ' urlLink Her First Time In A Bar - Sort Of ').  I knew that if it was just Keisha and I along for the trip, we'd wind up spending the entire time in the toy area.  Which leads me back to why I love my wife.  She has the style, the panache, the desire, really - to go clothes shopping for me.  I find it boring.  I like getting new clothes, don't get me wrong.  I just don't like the process of getting new clothes.  As usual, I sought for ways to see humor in the situation.  Two things came to mind.  First, I immediately noticed that between the Men's clothing department and the Men's dressing room was the Women's underwear section.  (snicker)  I told the attendant that I'd thought about grabbing me a piece of women's underwear to try on with my shorts and other stuff.  She said, 'I wouldn't stop you, if that's what you REALLY want to do.'  I also mentioned this to Jennie, to see what kind of reaction this would get out of her.  Secondly, as I was trying on a pair of shorts, I felt the urge to break wind.  I hurriedly got out of the shorts and did my business, trying hard to be discreet.  But that got me wondering, how many other men had tried on that same pair of shorts and broke wind in them?  Have you ever thought of that?   Update:  Jennie (not me) just came back down from showing the new clothes to my Mom.  I really wasn't that excited about it.  I guess you probably figured that out.         "

So today, we had to drop off the clothes to make room in our 1997 Honda Civic sedan.  I was going to take them to the main Goodwill office here in Dayton, but then, I remembered another location.  So Keisha and I went to this other location and dropped off the clothes, which I'll say, were worth a bucketload of money for next year's income tax return ('bucketload' is an inexact measurement, dontcha think?).  Then, we drove across the street to the  urlLink Professional Bartending Institute , where I had my mixology classes.  I showed Keisha the bar area, which is stocked with all the bottles, containing water, food coloring, and other non-alcoholic stuff.  I think Keisha was more impressed with the 'Necessary Room,' the name the school calls the unisex restroom for men and women.  'The toilet water's blue!' she chuckled. 'And it's all just my size!'

"5972",5972,449628,"Aries","               urlLink 8 Years Ago, We Said 'I Do'!    Today is our wedding anniversary, so today I offer up some memories of that special moment.  I'll have to share some memories of when we got engaged some other time.  I'm tempted to do that here, but that would make for a very looong post.  Come to think of it, if I shared about everything related to our wedding ceremony, that would make for a looong post, too.  So I'll share about one aspect.  I used to drive an hour one way to work, and, once we'd gotten engaged, I began to think of music I wanted for our wedding.  It got the point that, several months before our wedding, I had it all figured out, and I'd listen to it in order on the cassette player we had in our car.  It included 'Circle of Life' from The Lion King, 'Storms of Africa' by Enya, 'Watermark' by Enya, 'Say Once More' by Amy Grant, and 'Black or White' by Michael Jackson.  Like I said, I had it all figured out.  Our mothers would walk out to 'Circle of Life' (the opening version to the movie, not the Elton John version -- I wanted the initial African chant to be part of it).  They would then go up and light the two candles that we'd use to light the Unity candle, and they would also light a candle for Jennie's dad and my mom's parents, who are no longer with us.  Then, the Bridesmaids would each walk out to 'Storms of Africa' by Enya.  The music Jennie and her mom would walk out to was 'Watermark', also by Enya.  During the times I'd listened to it in the car, I broke down crying because it's such a beautiful song for such a beautiful moment.  When we broke to light the Unity candle and greet our mothers, Amy Grant's 'Say Once More' would be played.  Then, after the pronouncement of husband and wife, everyone would hear Michael Jackson's 'Black or White.'  As I thought about this some more, I recalled one wedding I'd attended in which the groom sung a song to his wife.  I'd heard of this being done before from a coworker who sang Oleta Adams' 'Get Here' to his bride as she walked down the aisle.  I decided that I wanted to sing to my bride, too.  I had just begun listening to Contemporary Christian music about six months prior to our wedding, and when I listened to Steven Curtis Chapman's 'I Will Be Here,' I knew that was the song.  So, I'd sing it on the way to and from work, along with the cassette, until I'd become confident.  I also need to take a moment to thank God for providing so much help to us from members of the church.  People came out from all over to volunteer to serve in so many ways during our ceremony.  One young woman in particular was incredible.  Her name is Svetlana, and she is originally from Bulgaria.  She is a very talented keyboard player and had played in front of church before.  Well, she offered to play the accompaniment while I sang.  One of the many things that makes her so special is that she picked up the music directly from the cassette - with no sheet music.  Well, this was to be one of the highlights of the wedding, and I knew it.  That made me all the more nervous.  The minister and my best man did their best to try to keep me calm: we prayed, of course.  When 'Watermark' by Enya started to play, I began to cry.  I couldn't help it.  I tried not to.  Fortunately, our moms were given each a box of Kleenex.  I reached over to grab a tissue from my mom.  And then, as the music continued to play (I'm tearing up as I write this), I saw my beautiful bride walking slowing down the aisle with her mom.  It was at about 11:20 in the morning.  Everyone was so quiet, cameras were flashing all over the place, and all I could think of was how beautiful she truly was.  As I took her hand, I could barely keep my eyes off her.  Then the time came for us to do our wedding vows.  We each had prepared our own, personal vows in addition to the traditional ones.  I let Jennie go first.  I remember her saying so many things, but one thing that stuck out was that she vowed to be my 'Balcony Person.'  Then it was my turn.  I had some words to say, and I finished it up by saying that the words to this song I was about to sing really conveyed how I felt.  Svetlana launched into the music, and then I felt my heart, throat, and chest clinch up from being so nervous.  I'm still amazed that any words came out at all.  I'm not sure if what I sang even qualifies as music, but somehow I got through it.  The words were more important anyway.  I think that most folks were just blown away that I'd sing to her anyway.  My mom still talks about it.  After that romantic butchering of Steven Curtis Chapman's song, the rest of the ceremony was easy.  I had gotten through it, and we were going to be married no matter what.  So, as the minister pronounced us as husband and wife, I gave Jennie was may be the world record for wedding kiss, and then we danced down the aisle to 'Black or White.'  I didn't find this out until later, but the groomsmen has orchestrated a cool and unexpected exit.  After Jennie and I left, they each put on a pair of sunglasses, pulled out one white glove, and then put it on.  They escorted their respective bridesmaid and walked out.  Eight years ago.  It's gone by both quickly and slowly.         "

Here comes another one.  Assigned seating at the dinner table has been a big thing for our daughter Keisha.  She decided a few days ago to make it a reality by using a permanent marker to write each family member's name on each chair, so that everyone had their own chair.  Permanent marker.  Our almost-6 year old is still learning to spell, so we all had to figure out whose chair went with whom.  At least she spelled my name correctly.   urlLink Nana 's chair has 'Nononon' on it.  She may have spelled Jennie's correctly, except for the upside-down, backwards 'e' that is pretty common with kids her age.  And we know that her own is hers because it has her name on it.  I remember buying this furniture on a '90 days same as cash' program 7 years ago.  I guess we need to continue 'breaking it in.'  But with black permanent marker?

"5984",5984,449628,"Aries","              Daddy - Daughter Date    The Venue  Tonight Jennie had one of those 'women parties' to attend.  You know the kind, where someone organizes the event and has someone demonstrate products and the women have a good time?  It's definitely a woman thing.  This meant that Keisha and I got to go on a date!  Whoo Hoo!  We decided to go to the  urlLink Dayton Mall  to get some dinner and hang out.  On the way there, we stopped by  urlLink Arrow Wine and Spirits  to look at bartending equipment.  After about 15-20 minutes we left and headed to the mall.   Escalator Escapades, Part 1  We walked inside the mall and headed to the escalator, since the food court is on the second floor.  Keisha was wearing her 'flip flop' sandals, and she's still getting used to them.  She was afraid of getting on because she didn't want her feet to get caught.  So I picked her up and placed her on one of the steps.  Getting off at the top was a breeze.   Hamburgers and Hearing Loss  We bought some cheeseburgers from a restaurant, and it turned out that the employee helping us was hearing-impaired, just as Keisha is!  I pointed this out to the both of them, especially so that Keisha could see an adult with hearing loss at work.  The woman's name was Lupka, and she does some sign language, just as we do.  Her sign name is the letter 'L' in a counterclockwise circle off to the side.  Keisha's is a 'curly K' down the side of her head, to correspond with her curly hair.  Mine is 'D' done as a horizontal figure-eight, because I love music.  I spent nearly all of my conversation with Keisha while we ate in sign.  Keisha, who understands sign language rather well, is reluctant to sign.  I think it has a little to do with 'being different' from others.  We encourage her to sign with us, but we don't force it on her.   The Carousel Incident  The Dayton Mall has a carousel, commonly referred to as a 'merry-go-round.'  Along with the horses, there is this bowl-shaped thing in which you can make yourself spin faster while the carousel spins around.  Keisha and I were really looking forward to getting on that part.  She was denied because some older kids got to it first.  Better luck next time, kiddo.  So she sat down on a chairlike-thingy, and I climbed atop one of the horses.  Let me tell you something about the horses.  They are  not  designed for adult men to ride.  I will only go as far as to say that it was, well, uncomfortable.  That's the most euphemistic way of saying it.   Escalator Escapade, Part 2   I was determined to help Keisha have a victory over her fear of riding the escalators while wearing her flip-flops.  After the carousel ride, we needed to find the restroom.  The closest one was on the second floor near the food court.  After some crying, Keisha finally reached her hands onto the railing, which is designed to move at the same rate as the stairs.  That movement encouraged her to move her feet onto a step so that she would not lose her balance.  I was so proud of her and I made sure she knew it.  You should have seen that smile on her face!   Restroom Switcheroo   So we headed for the family restroom.  These are really cute because they have a toilet set up for little kids to sit on; it's only about one-foot high off the floor.  Yet, Keisha asserted the fact that she's getting older and got to the adult toilet before I did.  This actually left me to the kiddie toilet!  It was funny, to say the least.  Fortunately for me, she let me use the adult-sized sink to wash my hands.   Escalator Escapade, Part 3   Undaunted in my quest to help Keisha conquer her fear of the escalator, we headed back.  A little bit of nervousness and reluctance, some reaching out to clutch my body - to no avail, of course - and she again got on the escalator by herself.  I decided that we would try it a couple more times.  Then she said she needed to go potty again.   'You Need to Try, Daddy.'   I let her take off her flip flops so that she could run back to the restroom faster.  When we got there, she said she needed to poop, but she decided to use the kiddie toilet this time, leaving me the adult toilet.  I overheard her grunting really hard, and I chuckled.  'Is everything okay over there?' I asked.  'Yeah, I'm just pushing really hard,' she replied.  Then a few seconds later: 'I'm going to take a rest.  You need to try, too, Daddy.'  'I  am ,' I asserted.  'No, you need to try to go poop, too,' she said.  'I did already.  This morning.'  'Downstairs?'  'Yes.'  Now that that was out of the way, we finished our business and headed toward the final escalator for our trip down.   Conclusion   We returned to our car, drove to pick up Jennie, and went for some ice cream.  Keisha summarized the entire experience in her own, special way.  There was a lot more that I could share, like some of the strange stuff Keisha said on the way home about what needs to happen if someone doesn't have a nose.  That will have to wait for another post.         "

"5988",5988,449628,"Aries","              Creative Parenting   Tonight we had a choice parenting moment.  I arrived home tonight from an outing with some guys to find my daughter Keisha neither in bed nor asleep.  She became quite emotional when I began talking with her about heading back upstairs to her bed.  The bottom-line reason she was out of bed, despite her myriad excuses ('My belly hurts', 'I want to see my Mommy', 'I want to wait for my Daddy to come home') was that she just didn't want to go to bed.  She said she wanted to go to the doctor because her belly was hurting.  Then she said she wanted to go to the hospital.  When I asked her why, she said, 'Because they will help me feel better.'  'What will they do?' I asked.  'Give me some medicine,' she replied.  Well, she needed to put her hearing aids back in (she sleeps with them so that she can hear what goes on), but she needed some lubricant for the earmolds, which fit inside her ear.  We've been using Cornhusker's Lotion, which works like a charm.  I told her that the stuff I put on her hearing aids was like medicine.  Keisha also takes Ditrophan for bladder spasms.  I asked my mom if she knew whether Keisha had been given her evening dose.  She asked Jennie, who said no.  So, I told Keisha that we still needed to give her the 'potty medicine,' which would help her feel better.  But we agreed to do this only if she wouldn't cry or act upset.  When she said that she couldn't, I told her I didn't believe her, and I smiled.  This caused a small grin to appear on her face.  'See?' I said.  'You can be happy if you want to.'  Well, she didn't want to have anything to do with that, and she turned around gruffly and yelled something.  In matters of this sort, I did what every father should do:  I had her sit down with me so that we could pray.  I prayed first and then she prayed.  After this, we agreed to go to the kitchen to get her medicine in a civil manner.   urlLink I mentioned earlier that I've been going to bartending school .  Keisha has picked up on this from hearing me tell Jennie and my mom about the classes.  Since the Ditrophan tastes terrible, we always let Keisha drink something afterward to wash away the taste.  So, I told Keisha that I was basically giving her a 'shot' of her medicine, and we agreed that half a cup of cherry kool-aid would work well as a 'chaser.'  She liked that idea.  I even showed her how to do it.  Having finished with that, I reiterated to her that she'd been given this medicine, and it should help her to feel better.  She returned to her bed, I tucked her in, and did our 'good night' ritual, which is a tradition  urlLink my mom  used to do with me.  It goes like this:  Dan:   Good night.  Keisha:   Sleep tight.  Dan:   Don't let the bedbugs bite.  Keisha:   Right! I turned her music on, and I left.  Mission: accomplished.         "

He said his car wouldn't start.  I told him I had jumper cables and that we could try to jump start his car.  Upon looking at them, he said they were the wrong kind for his battery and that he really should get a new battery.  He offered to give me $10 if I'd take him to the auto parts store just down the road so he could purchase one.  As we got in the car, I asked him if he went to church, and he replied with an enthusiastic 'YES!'  We started talking about some spiritual things, and he recommended that we pray together.  I obliged, of course.  I even gave him one of the business cards I'd made for my job search, which has my name, phone number, and address on it.  Just to keep in touch, you know.  I thought I was making a new friend.  He asked me to stop at a different auto parts store than what he originally said.  It was closer, so I did.  He went inside and returned about 30 seconds later.  He told me that he was three dollars short for the new battery and could I help him out.  He said he had the money at his home and could repay me after he got the new battery.  He also said that he needed $10 for the 'core charge' (core charge is what you pay when you don't have the original part with you when you buy a new one).  All I had was a $20 bill, so I handed it to him.  He went inside and returned about a minute later.  He said that they were going to bring the battery to his car, since it was just down the street.  He then asked me to take him home so he could get me $35 to repay me.  By this time I got a little suspicious because it seemed that he was taking me really out of my way.  He took me to the Santa Clara neighborhood of Dayton, which has a reputation for being a rough area.  He directed me to park in front of an apartment building and wait while he went inside to get me the money.  Fifteen minutes later, I realized that I was being scammed.  I left the area upset, angry, hurt, vengeful, yet prayerful.  I went home and shared the experience with mom and Jennie, and then I went for a walk to blow off some steam.  I was feeling seriously depressed about how stupid I was.  On the way to church, I was still feeling a little vengeful.  I fantasized about taking a crowbar to the guy's kneecaps.  Then I remembered the scripture that says that it's up to God to avenge.  At the men's meeting at church, I talked with a couple brothers in Christ about the situation.  I can be way too trusting.  The same kind of scam happened to me once before, about a year and a half ago.  I'm just grateful that I wasn't carjacked or hurt in some other way.  So I'm learning from the 'school of hard knocks' not to be too trusting of strangers.  My intentions were godly in trying to help that man, but I could have been more shrewd and gone about it a different way.  I saw the proverb that I listed at the beginning of this post, and I think it's a good one for me to store up and apply to my heart.  Thank you, Lord.         "

"6039",6039,449628,"Aries","              Dating My Wife   When Jennie and I were dating in 1994, I had just moved up to Dayton, and she still lived in the Cincinnati area.  We'd see each other maybe three times a week.  This was before we got engaged, which is a completely different story.  We started a tradition as our dates would end.  There was a White Castle restaurant close to where she lived, and we'd stop there before I dropped her off at her house (We didn't live together before we were married; I don't think that would have been what Jesus would have done, actually.).  We both liked their coffee and vanilla shakes, and we'd order one of each and then split them both by pouring half of one into the other, and vice versa.  Then we'd hang out for a bit until we'd finished our 'mochas.'  It was a really good 'bonding' time for both of us, and helped us deal with the reality that I'd be heading back to Dayton after I took her home.  As I took Jennie to work this morning, that memory just popped in my mind.  Yesterday she was off work, and we went to McDonald's to order some of the McGriddle sandwiches that I used to mock.  They're actually really good.  Maybe that experience is what helped me to remember our dates from 9 years ago.         "

"6050",6050,449628,"Aries","              Family Devotional   Tonight we had a family devotional about what it means to 'love our neighbor.'  For the text, I used the parable of 'The Good Samaritan' in  urlLink Luke 10:25-37 .  We didn't use 'Samaritan,' 'scribe,' 'priest,' or 'teacher of the law.'  To illustrate the story and to make it appear more real, we used some of Keisha's Barbie dolls (I think she has maybe 10 of them now, but this is not the time to go into the 'Naked Barbie Woodstock' that our house sometimes becomes.).  She hasn't given all the dolls names, so I told her we would give two of the ones we were using temporary names.  She, at first, had a problem with this.  I assured her that we were only using our imagination and that she could name the dolls whatever she wanted, even if it was at a later date.  For the person who was beaten and robbed, we chose one of Keisha's newer dolls, named Chelsea.  We chose one of her younger dolls, whom we named Ruth, to be a girl who, although she goes to Chelsea's school, doesn't want to be her friend.  We had a Ken doll, who was fortunately wearing shorts, to be a jock-type who thought he was too good-looking to help Chelsea.  Keisha also has a Fisher Price man, who we chose to be the 'Samaritan;' i.e., the one who does what is right in the story, and we named him John.  John is much smaller than the other dolls, and we let him have the pink Barbie car for the purpose of our story.  Also, John lives on the other side of town and goes to a completely different school.  John is also black.  For the 'bandits,' Mom and Jennie used about four of Keisha's other Barbies, and their job was to beat Chelsea up, tousle her hair, and steal her coat, shoes, and purse.  They did a fine job.  The expression on Keisha's face after the mugging and after Ken and Ruth ignored Chelsea was priceless.  The concern, the empathy.  It was great.  Then we brought out John, in his pink Barbie-mobile.  Here he was, in a hurry himself to get home because he had school the next day, and he pulled over to see what had happened to Chelsea.  He even helped her into his car, even though she was about twice his size!  Then he drove her to the hospital, gave the ER doctor a dime (the first coin I found in my pocket), and told the ER doctor to take care of her.  If there was any additional cost, he'd be by tomorrow to take care of it.  After this drama, I took Ruth, Ken, and John.  I sat them down in front of Keisha, and I asked her which one was more like a friend?  She rightly pointed to John.   Update, 30 Jul 2003:  You might appreciate  urlLink Mom's version , too.

He emailed this update: I would like to apologize for not keeping in touch lately, in my life right now I have grown quite selfish and very unloving, letting my emotions take control, and not looking where I needed to look for peace.  I really am struggling with my pride right now and allowing my hurt to control my life.  I am officially half way done.  My last two scores for my block tests have been a 90 and 92.  I had hoped that they would be higher but I will be grateful for what I got for scores.  I have to realize that if I tried my best that it should be good enough.  The next block is all about operating systems of Windows, ah back to something that I know about really well.  I am excited and trying not to get complacent.  R. is coming down starting on Thursday, it will be a nice change of the routine of loneliness.  She will be down here until Monday morning.  School shopping for K. will be interesting, I can't wait to hear what she thinks of R. and my taste.  Usually she is a part of the decision making process, but this year will be different.  I keep telling her think of it like Christmas, in the immortal words of forest gump 'Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what your goin get.'  Only difference, exchange the word life and put clothes.  I have taken a week of running off, not by choice though.  My ankle has been given me some trouble.

Since becoming law, the ADA has helped to improve the quality of life for more than 50,000 million Americans with physical and mental disabilities. As a result, it is easier today for people with disabilities to find a job, to enter public buildings, and to live more independently in their communities. These are all welcome changes in American life. As the father of a daughter who is hard of hearing, I am very grateful for this law, along with the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (IDEA).

"6057",6057,449628,"Aries","              Jesus Was A Blood Donor!   Yesterday, 24 July 2003, I donated blood at the local  urlLink Community Blood Center  in downtown Dayton.  It had been so long since I last donated that I couldn't remember when it was.  I have to wait at least 8 weeks for the red blood cells to regenerate before I can donate again, which means that I'll be able to donate again on Thursday, 18 September 2003.  I first donated blood when I was 17 years old at a blood drive held at our high school.  I have good veins, the phlebotomists say, for donating.  For most of my recent donations, I've used my left arm, since I'm right-handed.  Last night, the phlebotomist recommended I start alternating because of the scar tissue that has formed in my left arm from donating so much.  We'll see.  I don't like needles, but I donate anyway.  I usually am a bit nervous when the nurse pricks my finger to check if there is enough iron in it.  Then, when I head back to the blood collection area, I cannot look at the needle as the phlebotomist injects it in me.  My wife, on the other hand, is different: she wants to see what's going on.  The inside of my elbows are extremely ticklish.  Hence, I giggle and wriggle when the phlebotomist cleans the area with antiseptic and iodine.  This always makes the other staff members chuckle, too.  The entire experience of donating, from the time I arrived to the time I was finished, took about 45 minutes to an hour.  I share this experience for my own benefit so that I'll remember to donate in September.  I also share this to encourage you, gentle readers, to consider donating blood.  I understand that there are many medical reasons why some individuals cannot.  I've been ill a lot this year, and that has prevented me from donating earlier.  But even if you are not able to donate, you can still send out the message to others who might be able to do so.  I titled this post, 'Jesus Was A Blood Donor!' as a reminder that Jesus gave his blood so that we could be healed: He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed. ( urlLink 1 Peter 2:24 ) .  When I meditate on his 'blood donation,' I am more willing to endure a little discomfort - if you could even call it that - so that someone else can get a chance to live.  Take care!         "

"6063",6063,449628,"Aries","               urlLink Adult ADHD | a difficult diagnosis    In this article from WebMD, John Casey writes: Treating adult ADHD is fairly simple, but diagnosing it is difficult. Many adults realize they have ADHD when their children are diagnosed with it.   I've been re-reading Thom Hartmann's book  urlLink Attention Deficit Disorder: A Different Perception , which I was fortunate to get used at a bookstore last year.  I've shared my discoveries with my  urlLink mom , who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  She seems to believe that she may have ADHD as well.  It is not uncommon for both to be diagnosed as the other.  More from the article: In June, [Dr. Lenard Adler, director of the Combined Departments of Psychiatry and Neurology Adult ADHD Program at New York University School of Medicine,] and his colleagues released a survey of how 400 primary care doctors rated their ability to diagnose adult ADHD: Nearly 50 percent of the doctors said they do not feel confident in diagnosing ADHD in adults...  Working with the World Health Organization, Adler and his colleagues developed an ADHD screening test asking patients to answer six questions about their behavior. If they score high, they take a more precise, 18-item symptoms checklist test.         The advantage of the self-test is that it is patient friendly and standardized, says Adler. We hope this will take a great deal of guesswork out of diagnosis.         The ADHD self-assessment test, which is copyrighted by the WHO, is available online at  urlLink www.med.nyu.edu/Psych/training/adhd.html . I took a self-assessment type of test in January/February 2002, and I scored high in certain areas, which led my psychiatrist at that time to diagnose me with ADHD.         "

"6070",6070,449628,"Aries","              Visitation   Jennie and I attended the  urlLink visitation for the three people killed in the automobile crash this past Sunday .  It was a heart-wrenching experience.  The line to see and be with the dearly departed extended outside the funeral home.  As soon as we got to where the caskets were, I saw Kieran.  She was dressed in a nice outfit, wearing a baby hat.  A baby blanket was placed over her.  Sunday was her one-year old birthday.  She was born and she died on the same day, one year exactly.  We had met her parents before when they visited our church with Sarah and Bill.  Her parents are in their early to to mid twenties, and they remained beside her casket as people came in.  Kieran's mother clutched one of her daughter's stuffed toys, and both she and her husband openly wept aloud.  They said they were grateful that they had her for as long as they did, but it was obvious that there would still be a lot of grieving.  The next casket down was Sarah's.  She was only 22 years old.  It had been awhile since I'd last seen her.  I believe it was late last summer, at their oldest son Kade's 3 year old birthday party in a park.  The funeral home did a wonderful job with her makeup and outfit.  Yet, for some reason, I could tell she didn't look the same.  This gave me a little bit of an idea how horrific the accident was.  In the last casket was Hayden, Bill and Sarah's youngest son, 20 months old, born just six days after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.  He looked different, too from what I remember.  He was dressed in a 'little-man' outfit.  Bill remained by his and Sarah's caskets.  He said that he had been going through a cycle of emotions.  I told him that I didn't know what to say.  My mom had given me an envelope with some words she'd written for him.  I handed it to him, and he placed it in his suit jacket.  If there can be any good to come from this, it may be that the two babies never had an opportunity to grow up and reject God.  Sarah had been a disciple of Jesus Christ, and we can pray that her heart was right with God.

"6077",6077,449628,"Aries","              Out She Comes! Part 5   When the doctor said, 'Let's have this baby!' I was puzzled.  I thought that's what we were already doing.  What he really meant was that Jennie was going to start pushing.  I don't remember if he increased the Pitocin dose or not -- come to think of it, he may have reduced it -- I can't remember for sure.  So, as a contraction started Jennie began to push.  And push she did.  I had never seen anyone go through labor before, but I'd heard that women show so much strength that it behooves a man to appreciate and respect her so much more.  Cindy was taping the labor, which we later determined to be about 21 minutes long.  I can hardly imagine going through 21 minutes of pushing, but Jennie did.  I recall Sue asking Cindy, toward the end of that 21 minutes, 'Is that hair I see?'  which I took to mean that Keisha was close.  After about 17 minutes, the doctor became concerned.  Every contraction was beginning to affect Keisha's heartbeat.  We weren't getting anywhere with the natural birthing, so he ordered a Caesarean section.  An anesthesiologist came in to administer a 'spinal' to Jennie, but she couldn't find the place in Jennie's back to inject the anesthesia.  So the doctor ordered a 'general' anesthetic, which would put Jennie to sleep.  Jennie was taken to an Operating Room, where they would perform the Caesarean.  Because she was under a general anesthetic, I wasn't allowed in the room.  I felt very saddened by it.  Cindy, who manned the camera, asked me to comment on camera what was going on.  I explained it to an older Keisha, who would later be watching this video.  Then I heard something that made me break into tears.  I heard our baby crying behind me.  Keisha was born at 10:42 PM, July 17, 1997!  The nurse came out to get a port-a-crib thingy, which they would use to transport Keisha to the Transitional Nursery.  She said that I could come in to see her.  So Cindy handed me the camera.  Just minutes from being outside the womb, there she was: all wrapped up in cloths, crying.  I was in awe.  God's creation, which we'd waited for nine months, was here!  I followed the nurse to the Transitional Nursery, where I met Ms. Yvetta, the Transitional Nurse.  She checked all of Keisha's vitals, and I was able to tape the whole event.  It would be important, I knew, for Jennie and an older Keisha to see all of this.  Yvetta gave Keisha her first bath, and Keisha cried when she got her hair washed.  She still doesn't like getting it washed.  Then it was time for me to clean her umbilical cord.  I was so nervous; I didn't want to hurt my baby or anything like that.  Yvetta reassured me that everything was okay.  Then I got to put her very first diaper on her.  It was a little thing!  But then again, so was my baby!  Sort of.  She weighed in at 7 pounds, 2-1/2 ounces, and 21 inches long.  After the Transitional Nursery, we took Keisha to go meet her Mommy, who was waking up in the Recovery Room.  It was a beautiful event.  I can remember holding our baby in my arms, just like it was yesterday.  Having a baby changes your life forever.         "

The meeting conveyed a lot of important stuff for us parents, but there were a couple of times when Keisha turned to me and said, 'Are they almost done?'  Then, after the meeting adjourned the kids went to their chairs and sat down.  I went to Keisha and said, 'I'm going to go now, and Ms. Fabian will take care of you.  She knows exactly what time the bus will be coming to take you home.'  Keisha smiled.  I gave her a kiss, and then I left, half wishing that I could be a fly on the wall.         "

Take a short walk around the block or through a mall after dinner.  The more exercise you get the more energized you become.  Always check with your doctor before beginning any exercise routine.  Eat healthier by eating a variety of foods.   Make sure you get enough of the right types of foods each day.  The National Institutes of Health recommend five or more servings of vitamin-packed fruits and vegetables every day for better health.  Limit most foods with caffeine since they provide an artificial boost but little nutrition.  Go outside for a few minutes in the sunshine.   This will not only feel good, but the vitamin D in the sunlight will actually help your body process calcium, an essential nutrient for strong bones.  Get a good night's sleep.   For more energy try going to bed a half-hour before you normally do at least one night a week.  Finally, do something that makes you happy at least once a week.  Read a book; have coffee with a friend; listen to music -- anything that you enjoy and that you look forward to doing.  You might find that making time for yourself is the best 'energizer' of all.

I'm not used to playing host to these kinds of things, and I find myself feeling insecure: Is so-and-so feeling 'tied-in' with everyone else?  She looks bored.  You have the usual, gregarious folk that congregate together, of course.  Not everyone we invited showed up.  Keisha was initially a little disappointed.  But that dissipated once others started arriving.  My aunt and uncle drove up from Cincinnati, with their daughter DJ, who is a little younger than Keisha's age.  Also, two boys from Keisha's class in school came over.  I had grilled some hotdogs and bratwurst before the party started, and mom and Jennie set everything else up.  We had all the guests help themselves to the food, and I started the movie 'Spy Kids 2'.  After about a half hour, I could tell that some of the kids were a bit distracted ('When are we gonna have cake and ice cream?  When is Keisha gonna open her presents?').  We decided to stop the movie midway to serve the cake and ice cream and for Keisha to open her presents.  Once that was over with, I asked them if they wanted to watch the rest of the movie.  Most of them had decided to do other things, and others had to go to other birthday parties.  Eventually, the only kids left were Keisha and DJ, who were playing with Keisha's new Barbie stuff.  I decided to finish the movie, play the music video, and rewatch it with the director's commentary.  Now, I just hope there is a little bit of time before Keisha starts planning next year's birthday party.  Mom said earlier that next year's color is going to be brown.  That's right, folks, my daughter changes her favorite color each year.  Two years ago, it was green.  Last year it was pink.  Now for her 6th year it's blue.  This kid practically has her whole life planned out.  What an imagination.         "
"6093",6093,449628,"Aries","              Out She Comes! Part 4   At the Wendy's inside Miami Valley Hospital, I tried to relax and enjoy a meal, while Jennie was in the Berry Women's Pavillion getting ready to have our first child.  I spotted a copy of the Dayton Daily News, and I remembered that they have a section where they describe 'This Day In History.'  Since that day, July 17, 1997, was going to be Keisha's birthday, I found the section and cut it out to keep.  I looked around and wondered silently what the other people in the restaurant were doing at the hospital.  How many, for example, were there because of a baby being born, too?  After I finished my meal, I returned to Jennie's room.  Cindy had set up the video camera and was offering Jennie some ice chips.  We heard two sets of beeps: one was Jennie's heartbeat, and the other was Keisha's!  We saw some instrumentation that showed how intense the contractions were.  I set up the tape player to play the 'Lullaby' tape I'd made for Keisha a month before.  It consisted of lullabies from around the world.  I was able to record the entire CD on both sides of the tape.  We would play it for Keisha at home before going to the hospital, and we hoped it would be a kind of 'welcoming sound' for Keisha as she was born.  Jennie was a trooper, and my respect for her was about to grow 1000%.  We'd do the breathing exercises we'd learned at the Lamaze classes to help alleviate the pain, but after a few hours, Jennie wanted some relief.  She asked for Nubain.  The doctors increased the Pitocin to help the contractions along, and we waited for a little while longer, before the doctor came in at about 8:30 PM to say, 'Let's have this baby!'  to be continued...

"6094",6094,449628,"Aries","              Friday Funk   I've been in a funk for almost the entire day today.  I woke up reluctantly, and strained to keep my eyes open as I took Jennie to work.  I returned home and laid back down until the alarm went off at 9:30 AM, when I needed to get Keisha up and ready for her speech therapy appointment.  We each ate some toast, took our medicines, and by 10:30 AM we headed to Children's Medical Center.  Keisha's speech therapy appointment went well.  I spent most of the time reading, but I felt like I could have just napped.  After her appointment, Keisha and I returned home.  I persuaded her that we needed to lay down for a nap until PBS Kids came on at 1:30 PM.  At 1:30 PM the alarm went off, and I turned on PBS for Keisha.  I reset the alarm for 2:30 PM, since I'd needed to pick Jennie up from work.  Jennie and I returned home, and I laid myself back down for another nap.  We received a phone call from our realtor stating that someone wanted to see the house this afternoon at 5:30 PM.  So we all decided to head to Kroger to pick up some food supplies for Keisha's birthday party tomorrow.  Then we came home and ate dinner.  After that, I sat on the couch to watch the movie Enemy at the Gate, with Jude Law and Joseph Fiennes.  Good movie.  Then Jennie and I came down here to head to bed.  I hope that tomorrow I feel much better.  Maybe it's the medicine, the nutrition, the sleep, the weather, or a combination of all that created the physical/emotional funk.  Tomorrow is Keisha's 'Spy Kids 2' party, so blogging may be light.         "
"6095",6095,449628,"Aries","              Out She Comes! Part 3   We had taken 'Lamaze' classes at Miami Valley Hospital about a month before Keisha was to be born.  It was good for us, especially since this was our first child.  One of the big reasons we chose to have Keisha at Miami Valley was the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).  That hospital was the only one in the area with an NICU.  I cannot remember if there was a full moon that day or not, but there were so many women in labor when we arrived that there was no room for us in the regular triage area, so they placed us in a high-risk maternity room.  The main focus at this point was to see whether or not Jennie was, in fact, in labor.  So we waited for a little while, chuckling about the fact that so many other women were giving birth today at the hospital, too.  Jennie told me that she definitely would like to have the baby while we were already at the hospital, so we were hoping for the triage nurse to see things that way, too.  When the triage nurse finally came, she took a sample of the fluid that we thought would indicate that Jennie's water had broken.  She determined that it was amniotic fluid, which meant that, yes, Jennie would be having the baby.  The hospital staff then led us to a 'birthing room,' and Jennie was given some Pitocin to help start the contractions.  We also called the two women she wanted to be present: Cindy and Sue.  Jennie had been at Miami Valley when Cindy had given birth to her daughter Emiko.  Sue was a close friend from church.  Then, I had to make another important phone call.   Jennie and I had decided that living in the apartment we had in Fairborn was going to be too expensive once we had Keisha, so we were searching for another place that was cheaper.  She had made an appointment for us to go see an apartment in Dayton for the afternoon of the 17th.  I called our future landlord and left a message, saying that we would not be able to make the appointment because we were, um, having a baby.  When Cindy arrived, she told me I should go get something to eat, because Jennie was going to be okay for a little while.  Miami Valley has a Wendy's restaurant inside, so I went there.  to be continued...         "

Pressures from work, anxiety about becoming a father for the first time, and other responsibilities at church and elsewhere, meant that I had to spend a lot of time in prayer.  I remember at least one nearly all-night prayer time along the Great Miami River in Dayton, begging God for the strength.  As I filled up the gas tank in Sidney and headed south on I-75 on July 17th, I continued praying.  Thankful to God, but greatly nervous about what was going on.  I think I was concerned for both Jennie and Keisha.  I really wanted to make it to the hospital in time.  Fortunately, I had an hour's worth of drive time.  When I got home, I rushed in to find Jennie all ready to go.  I grabbed the suitcase with her clothes.  I also had a tape recorder that I had been using for about a week to record the thoughts that were rushing through my mind.  We left for Miami Valley Hospital, and I spoke to the tape recorder, describing what was going on.  I then asked Jennie for her comments.  She said something like, 'I think Daddy is more nervous than anyone right now.'  It was the truth.  We arrived at the hospital parking garage and headed for the admission area.  We completed all the paperwork that was necessary.  Because Jennie wasn't in active labor -- it was later determined that, when the doctor said her water had broken, it was a 'slow leak' - otherwise things would have been different.  to be continued...

"6099",6099,449628,"Aries","              Out She Comes!, Part 1   During the last month that Jennie was pregnant with Keisha, we would go to the doctors office every week to see how far she was.  The next appointment happened to be on Thursday, July 17, 1997, at 2 PM.  We woke up that morning just as we had done in previous mornings.  After eating breakfast and studying my Bible, I drove the hour-long drive from Fairborn to Sidney, Ohio, where I worked as an Environmental Engineer.  I had been struggling with getting the Release Prevention Control and Countermeasure (RPCC) Plan finished.  Also that day we had a water-based paint waste pick up, which I was required to supervise.  At about 11 AM, just as I had finished all the paperwork for the waste shipment, my pager went off.  I looked down to see what it said: 431-0014 911, which was the code Jennie and I had agreed upon to indicate that it was time for me to take her to the hospital.  Could it really be THE time? I thought.  I walked over to the Shipping and Receiving office, which was located nearby and called my wife.  I think I might have had my water broken.  I called the doctors office, and they said that I shouldnt go in for my appointment but instead that we should go straight to the hospital.  OK, I said.  Let me go back to my office so that I can drop off my stuff, and Ill be on my way.  As I hustled back to my office, I told all my other co-workers that today was the day.  Were going to the hospital!  When I got to the car, I noticed that  of course  I was almost out of gas.  Remember that we lived an hour away from where I worked and Jennies water had just broken.  to be continued...         "

Dad would let me use his bike to ride around during the summer.  It had a bike chain lock on it.  I loved riding that bike.  My dad and stepmother would let me head off for the entire day as long as I showed up in time for dinner.  One of the things I liked doing was going to the Service Merchandise store on Colerain Avenue, across from Northgate Mall.  I loved looking at the electronics, especially the keyboards.  Well, on this particular day, I didn't lock Dad's bike up because I thought I'd only be in the store for a short time.  In typical ADHD fashion, I wound up spending at least an hour, fixated on all the stuff that was inside the store.  When I came back out to leave, the bike was gone.  I think I called home to see if June (my stepmother) would come pick me up, because I was pretty far away from home to walk.  I felt so terrible, and I knew I was going to get it from my Dad.  I went to my room and waited until he came home from work.  I didn't know what to say, except to tell him what happened.  I think I was grounded for a little while.  A few years later, still feeling a little bit guilty about the situation, I had enough money from a part-time job, and I bought two new 12-speed bikes: one for me and one for my Dad.

On Saturday, while we were  urlLink at the park , our realtor brought someone through the house, and this individual has made an offer.  We had a very brief meeting with a bancruptcy attorney yesterday.  I like this guy.  He came out in his white socks; i.e., without any shoes on.  His office was huge, too.  I had had an ADHD moment, in which I originally wrote down that our appointment was at 4PM in two areas of my planner, but when I transferred it to the daily page, I wrote it down as being at 4:30PM.  So, we had to reschedule the appointment.  This was a good thing, since we still have much paperwork to go through.   urlLink I only went through the upstairs mail yesterday .  We have an entire table and then some to go through downstairs.  I told the lawyer that I'd been in denial, and he replied that my behaviour was typical.  He encouraged us to continue going through the mail... that the mail cannot hurt us... that there's no such thing as debtor's prison (it was done away with 200 years ago - thank God!).  The attorney also gave us a more realistic understanding of what our options were, including some stipulations that are present with us doing a short-sell.  After Jennie and I came home, we took Keisha to her new school, Valerie Elementary, for the open house.  It was encouraging to see all the parents there, to meet Keisha's Kindergarten teacher, and to see some parents and kids we'd known from Gettysburg, the school Keisha attended last year.  I think it's a bit of an understatement to say that Keisha is excited about going to Kindgergarten, and I think we're all going to enjoy it with her.  After we came home, Keisha did something that was just so sweet.  Entirely on her own, she pulled out 4 bowls, 4 spoons, and made sure that there were 4 cups.  She then went to the freezer to get the two half-gallon containers of ice cream and made us all dessert!  No one told her to do that; she decided to do it on her own!

I've been taking 10 mg of Lexapro, an antidepressant, and 1 to 3 mg of Diazepam, generic for Valium, for anxiety.  I told the doc about all the stuff that's been going on with our family recently.  I believe that most of my depression and anxiety are situational or circumstantial.  For the most part, I said, I believe the medicine is helping.  He asked about how things have been going with me picking at scabs, and I told him that hasn't changed.  He's decided to increase the dosage of Lexapro to 20 mg a day.  I asked him about my feeling tired a lot from the medicine.  He told me that Valium has a long half-life, and that he had prescribed it awhile back because it was less expensive.  Now that our family is on CareSource, he said, perhaps I could try a different one with a shorter half-life.  Not at this time.  But, the big development... I told him about ADHD symptoms I and others in my family have been noticing.  I explained to him how my previous doctor came up with the diagnosis - there was a standardized, self-assessment test that I took (I don't remember the exact name; perhaps it's in the journal archives for January or February 2002).  Based on how I scored, my doctor at that time diagnosed me with ADHD and prescribed Adderall for me.  I told my current doc that it had worked for me, and he decided to get me started on it again.  Psychology and psychiatry are not exact sciences.  It's not like when you go to your family doctor, and he or she examines your ears, nose, throat, and says, 'Aha!  You have a sinus infection.  Here's this antibiotic that should clear it up after a few days.'  I guess realizing this difference helps me to have a bit more patience (no pun intended).         "

"6117",6117,449628,"Aries","              Birthday Preview: Invites, Presents, and Giving Back   Keisha will be 6 years old this Thursday, July 17th.  She was also born on a Thursday.  I'm reminded that, every 6 years, the date and the day of the week are the same.  This phenomenon makes sense when you consider that there is a leap year during that time; otherwise it would be 7 years.  We've been planning a party for next Saturday, the 19th.  It will be a ' urlLink Spy Kids 2 ' movie party.  Ever since  urlLink Keisha and I went to see the movie at the theatre back in January , she's talked about having a 'Spy Kids' birthday party.  Keisha's inviting friends from school and from church.  She's got a terrific memory.  The bus that would pick her and her schoolmates up for preschool would stop directly in front of the kids' homes.  She's been wanting to invite a boy named Vernon, but we didn't know exactly where he lived.  Keisha knew where he lived, so today we drove to the apartment complex, and she pointed out his apartment building.  No one was home, so I left a note, indicating that Keisha was inviting him to her birthday party and to call us for more information.  She also wants to invite her former teacher, Miss Jean.  Jennie has printed up tickets for the kids to have, and she bought the DVD from Wal*Mart last week.  She'd never seen it, so we'd planned for her to watch it before the birthday party so that she could have a clearer idea of what it was about.  We agreed that Keisha could get the movie today, and we all could watch it tonight.  Here's how I went about doing it.  We originally planned to preview without her knowing about it, so I unwrapped the DVD and placed it high on the bookshelf, inside a boardgame box lid.  We told her that she could have one of her birthday presents tonight, but she'd have to find it.  So, I led her outside, in various rooms of the house, to search for this present.  We even gave her a hint by describing what shape and size it was, but we didn't tell her it was the movie.  I knew that she would not be able to find out where I'd originally hid the movie without some intervention.  When she went to the laundry room to look, I took it from its hiding place and put it atop of her bookshelf, which is situated close to the stairs.  She returned from the laundry room, stating that she couldn't find it.  I told her that maybe it was upstairs, and we headed up the stairs.  I hesitated and turned back to her bookshelf.  'Did we look everywhere down here, Keisha?'  She saw where I was looking and this excited, giggle-happy expression came over her face.  I handed her the DVD, and we went upstairs to watch the movie.  After the movie, while I was watching the special features (a ritual I always have to perform when watching a DVD for the first time), Keisha came to me and said that she'd made a card for me.  She told me I'd need to find it.  It was basically going to be a similar hide-and-seek game like we played when she found her movie.  Imagine my surprise to find that she'd made, not just one, but TWO cards for me!  God has truly given us a gift in Keisha.         "

"6131",6131,449628,"Aries","              Mind Change   I decided yesterday that I really needed a mind change.  I was feeling so much angst, which you could probably tell from yesterday's post.  So I decided to spend some time in my Bible.  First, I read through the story of Joseph, in the book of Genesis.  Next I read through the first few chapters of Judges.  Then, I realized that what I really needed was the encouragment found in Romans 8.  The entire chapter is very encouraging, because there are several different thoughts conveyed there.  As I read through the chapter, I stopped when I found  urlLink verse 18 : I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. I began to meditate on the 'future glory,' and that helped me to get a little bit more perspective.  Also, it's been hard to pray about this.  There is so much going on that I often don't know what specifically to pray.  Then I read  urlLink this passage : In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express.  And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance with God's will. So that helped, too.  After this, I read through a number of the Psalms, and I noted that the recurring theme of 'waiting for God' was present.  How hard it is to wait!  I feel like I've been waiting for so long for things to get better.  To some extent, they have; but, in another sense, they haven't.  I find myself asking, 'How much longer do I have to wait, Lord?'  I guess I also have been struggling with this concept of entitlement.  I feel that I should be entitled to have a good credit rating, that I should have a successful job, that I should be able to pay all my bills on time, that I should be able to pay on our mortgage and not lose our house.  But God never promises any of that.  I'm realizing that, the only thing I need is Him.  I get to have my wife, daughter, and mom live with me.  We have food, shelter, clothing.  All of these other things that are typical in our Western lifestyle are not guaranteed by God.  He is also showing how easily he can take all of it away.  It's revealing much about where  urlLink my heart is , to say the least: For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.   I remember, as a young Christian, praying to God, 'Give me more faith!' along with other things.  At the time, I just wanted a more godly character.  I had no idea that God would answer my prayers in this manner.  Would I have still prayed the same prayers?  Probably.  I'm reminded of a song I wrote back then, based on struggles I was going through.  It still applies.  It's called ' urlLink Tough Enough To Bend .'         "
"6132",6132,449628,"Aries","              Why We Love Kids    These little snippets come forwarded by  urlLink Mom  via email from  urlLink Karen  (Thanks!)   NUDITY  I was driving with my three young children one warm summer evening when a woman in the convertible ahead of us stood up and waved. She was stark naked! As I was reeling from the shock, I heard my 5-year-old shout from the back seat, 'Mom! That lady isn't wearing a seat belt!'     HONESTY   My son Zachary, 4, came screaming out of the bathroom to tell me he'd dropped his toothbrush in the toilet. So I fished it out and threw it in the garbage. Zachary stood there thinking for a moment, then ran to my bathroom and came out with my toothbrush. He held it up and said with a charming little smile, 'We better throw this one out too then, 'cause it fell in the toilet a few days ago.     OPINIONS   On the first day of school, a first-grader handed his teacher a note from his mother. The note read, 'The opinions expressed by this child are not necessarily those of his parents.'    KETCHUP   A woman was trying hard to get the ketchup to come out of the jar. During her struggle the phone rang so she asked her 4-year-old daughter to answer the phone. 'It's the minister, Mommy,' the child said to her mother. Then she added, 'Mommy can't come to the phone to talk to you right now. She's hitting the bottle.'     MORE NUDITY   A little boy got lost at the YMCA and found himself in the women's locker room. When he was spotted, the room burst into shrieks, with ladies grabbing towels and running for cover. The little boy watched in amazement and then asked, 'What's the matter haven't you ever seen a little boy before?'     POLICE # 1   While taking a routine vandalism report at an elementary school, I was interrupted by a little girl about 6 years old. Looking up and down at my uniform, she asked, 'Are you a cop?' 'Yes,' I answered and continued writing the report. 'My mother said if I ever needed help I should ask the police. Is that right?' 'Yes, that's right,' I told her. 'Well, then,' she said as she extended her foot toward me, 'would you please tie my shoe?'     POLICE # 2   It was the end of the day when I parked my police van in front of the station. As I gathered my equipment, my K-9 partner, Jake, was barking, and I saw a little boy staring in at me. 'Is that a dog you got back there?' he asked. 'It sure is,' I replied. Puzzled, the boy looked at me and then the back of the van. Finally he said, 'What'd he do?'    ELDERLY   While working for an organization that delivers lunches to elderly shut-ins, I used to take my 4-year-old daughter on my afternoon rounds. She was unfailingly intrigued by the various appliances of old age, particularly the canes, walkers and wheelchairs. One day I found her staring at a pair of false teeth soaking in a glass. As I braced myself for the inevitable barrage of questions, she merely turned and whispered, 'The tooth fairy will never believe this!'     DRESS-UP   A little girl was watching her parents dress for a party. When she saw her dad donning his tuxedo, she warned, 'Daddy, you shouldn't wear that suit.' 'And why not, darling?' 'You know that it always gives you a headache the next morning.'     DEATH   While walking along the sidewalk in front of his church, our minister heard the intoning of a prayer that nearly made his collar wilt. Apparently, his 5-year-old son and his playmates had found a dead robin. Feeling that proper burial should be performed, they had secured a small box and cotton batting, then dug a hole and made ready for the disposal of the deceased. The minister's son was chosen to say the appropriate prayers and with sonorous dignity intoned his version of what he thought his father always said: 'Glory be unto the Faaaather, and unto the Sonnn ..... and into the hole he gooooes.'   SCHOOL   A little girl had just finished her first week of school. 'I'm just wasting my time,' she said to her mother. 'I can't read, I can't write and they won't let me talk!'     BIBLE   A little boy opened the big family bible. He was fascinated as he fingered through the old pages. Suddenly, something fell out of the Bible. He picked up the object and looked at it. What he saw was an old leaf that had been pressed in between the pages.   'Mama, look what I found', the boy called out.   'What have you got there, dear?' With astonishment in the young boy's voice, he answered, 'I think it's Adam's underwear.         "

This rest area had been closed for a very long time, probably about three years.  The  urlLink Ohio Department of Transportation  completely redid it.  It looks good, too.

We have concluded that he does not care whether the other dog is male or female:  he is still 'interested' (nice euphemism, huh?).    Like this morning, after Keisha left for school.  I took Jake for a little walk without a leash in the little cul de sac area where we live.  I'm glad I spotted the male poodle with his owner first and grabbed Jake's collar to hold on to him.  The poodle's owner mentioned that the poodle prefers male dogs to female.  I was slightly relieved to discover that Jake is not alone in his preference for dogs of the same sex.  Last Saturday we took him to my Dad's farm in Indiana, and he met Icky, short for Ichabod, who is a dog old enough to be Jake's grandfather.  Let's just say that Icky made it very clear up front that he was not interested.  It was fun to watch the two of them interact.  As Jake would get close to Icky, Icky would growl and start to chase after Jake.  Jake, the much younger and faster dog, would get away unscathed, yet with his tail between his legs nevertheless.  Then, as I walked Jake around the farm, Icky followed.  As Jake would 'mark' his spots around the farm, Icky would follow up with 'marks' of his own.  While we humans were chatting, Jake and Icky would take turns marking the firewood pile, for example.  Silly dog.         "
"6147",6147,449628,"Aries","              Biblical Confirmation on Coffee?   From an email forum to which I subscribe: A man and his wife were having an argument about who should brew the coffee each morning.   The wife said, 'You should do it, because you get up first, and then we don't have to wait as long to get our coffee.'   The husband said, ' You are in charge of the cooking around here, and you should do it, because that is your job, and I can just wait for my coffee.'   The wife replied, 'No you should do it, and besides it is in the Bible that the man should do the coffee.'   The husband replied, ' I can't believe that.  Show me.'   So she fetched the Bible, opened the New Testament, and showed him at the top of several pages, that it indeed says:  'HEBREWS'          "

"6155",6155,449628,"Aries","              Darwin Awards   In case you have been waiting breathlessly for this year's Darwin Awards, here they are. The awards this year are, once again, truly classic.  These awards are given each year to bestow upon (the remains of) that individual, who through single-minded self-sacrifice, has done the most to remove undesirable elements from the human gene pool. Just think... until these events, these same people were walking the streets like normal people.   5th RUNNER-UP   Goes to a San Anselmo, California man who died when he hit a lift tower at the Mammoth Mountain ski area while riding down the slope on a foam pad. The 22-year old David Hubal was pronounced dead at Central Mammoth Hospital. The accident occurred about 3 a.m., the Mono County Sheriff's department said. Hubal and his friends apparently had hiked up a ski run called Stump alley and undid some yellow foam protectors from lift towers, said Lt. Mike Donnelly of the Mammoth Lakes Police Department. The pads are used to protect skiers who might hit towers.  The group apparently used the pads to slide down the ski slope and Hubal crashed into a tower. It has since been investigated and determined the tower he hit was the one with its pad removed.   4th RUNNER-UP   Goes to Robert Puelo, 32, was apparently being disorderly in a St. Louis market. When the clerk threatened to call the police, Puelo grabbed a hot dog, shoved it into his mouth and walked out without paying. Police found him unconscious in front of the store. Paramedics removed the six-inch wiener from his throat where it had choked him to death.   3rd RUNNER-UP   Goes to poacher Marino Malerba of Spain, who shot a stag standing above him on an overhanging rock and was killed instantly when it fell on him.   2nd RUNNER-UP   'Man loses face at party.' A man at a West Virginia party (probably related to the winner last year, a man in Arkansas who used the .22 bullet to replace the fuse in his pickup truck) popped a blasting cap into his mouth and bit down, triggering an explosion that blew off hi lips, teeth, and tongue. Jerry Stromyer, 24, of Kincaid, bit the blasting cap as a prank during the party late Tuesday night, said Cpl. M.D. Payne. 'Another man had it in an aquarium hooked to a battery and was trying to explode it.' 'It wouldn't go off and this guy said I'll show you how to set it off.' He put it into his mouth, bit down and it blew all his teeth out and his lips and tongue off, Payne said. Stromyer was listed in guarded condition Wednesday with extensive facial injuries, according to a spokesperson at Charleston Area Medical Division. 'I just can't imagine anyone doing something like that,' Payne said.   1st RUNNER-UP   Doctors at Portland University Hospital said an Oregonman shot through the skull by a hunting arrow is lucky to be alive and will be released soon from the hospital. Tony Roberts, 25, lost his right eye last weekend during an initiation into a men's rafting club, Mountain Men Anonymous (probably known now as Stupid Mountain Men Anonymous) in Grants Pass, Oregon. A friend tried to shoot a beer can off his head, but the arrow entered Robert's right eye. Doctors said that had the arrow gone 1 millimeter to the left, a major blood vessel would have been cut and Roberts would have died instantly. Neurosurgeon Doctor Johnny Delashaw at the University Hospital in Portland said the arrow went through 8 to 10 inches of brain with the tip protruding at the rear of his skull, yet somehow managed to miss all major blood vessels. Delashaw also said that had Roberts tried to pull the arrow out on his own he surely would have killed himself.  Roberts admitted afterwards that he and his friends had been drinking that afternoon. Said Roberts, I feel so dumb about this.' No charges have been filed, but the Josephine County district attorney's office said the initiation stunt is under investigation.   Now, THIS YEAR'S WINNER   (The late) John Pernicky and his friend, (the late) Sal Hawkins, of the great state of Washington, decided to attend a local Metallica concert at the George Washington amphitheater. Having no tickets (but having had 18 beers between them), they thought it would be easy to 'hop' over the nine foot fence and sneak into the show.  They pulled their pickup truck over to the fence and the plan was for Mr. Pernicky, who was 100 pounds heavier than Mr. Hawkins) to hop the fence and then assist his friend over. Unfortunate for (the late) Mr. Pernicky, there was a 30-foot drop on the other side of the fence.  Having heaved himself over, he found himself crashing through a tree. His fall was abruptly halted (and broken, along with his arm) by a large branch that snagged him by his shorts. Dangling from the tree with a broken arm, he looked down and saw some bushes below him. Possibly figuring the bushes would break his fall, he removed his pocket knife and proceeded to cut away his shorts to free himself from the tree.  Finally free, Mr. Pernicky crashed into holly bushes. The sharp leaves scratched his ENTIRE body and now, without the protection of his shorts, a holly branch penetrated his rectum. To make matters worse, on landing his pocket knife penetrated his thigh.  Hawkins, seeing his friend in considerable pain and agony, threw him a rope and tried to pull him to safety by tying the rope to the pickup truck and slowly driving away. However, in his drunken haste/state, he put the truck into reverse and crashed through the fence landing on his friend and killing him. Police arrived to find the crashed pickup with its driver thrown 100 feet from the truck and dead at the scene from massive internal injuries.  Upon moving the truck, they found John under it half-naked, scratches on his body, a holly stick in his rectum, a knife in his thigh, and his shorts dangling from a tree branch 25 feet in the air.

That's one of the many things I said to  urlLink my mom  before she got on the bus to head back to Texas on Monday afternoon.  Even now, at 4:45 AM, when she is probably in Tennessee somewhere, I recall the moment so vividly.  And with tears.  Aside from my own family (Jennie and Keisha), I am the closest to my mom.  I remember  urlLink when she arrived at our home on Sunday, October 27, 2002 .  Wow.  She lived with us for 11 months.  I often wonder why we cry during these times of parting.  I remember the first time my sister and I were heading back home after spending a Christmas break with my mom and family in Texas.  She was the more emotional among all of us then.  But I let the tears flow on Monday afternoon.  Keisha has still been on her fall intercession, so she was with me.  I could tell she felt very sad, but she didn't cry like mom and me.  I kept telling her that it was okay to cry, though.  I guess I cry because I know I won't be able to see my mom, whom I love so very dearly, for a long time.  I won't be able to stop by her room upstairs and chat about what happened at work, or life in general.  She won't be joining us any more for family dinners.  She won't be teasing Keisha around the house any more.  I miss these things already.  At the same time, we're almost out of this house.  We closed the short-sale on Friday, and we're moving this coming weekend.  Almost two and a half years' worth of memories have been accumulated, and I find it heart-wrenching to have to deal with the change.  To be true, I've been in denial for so long.  I guess you could say that I'm grieving the change that's gone on in our family.  Jennie has helped me to get to the point where I'm able to accept what's happening, and I lover her all the more for it.  With all the financial trouble we've been in this year, the one thing that was constant was that we had this house.  It's been comfortable to live here.  I guess it's been too comfortable.  Similarly, mine and Jennie's lives have changed.  When we first moved into this place, I had a job as an IT consultant, making enough money so that Jennie didn't have to work and could stay home with Keisha.  Now, Jennie works during the day as a nurse's aide, and I'm a bartender, working days and nights.  Our income is not what it was when we first moved into the house either.  Well, change is gonna do us good.  I'm glad to be moving into an apartment.  Owning a house was just too much for us to handle, and we've learned a lot about the real estate market in this area, too.  I'm praying that we'll find neighbors that can become our best friends and for Keisha to find someone her age with whom she can play.  We'll see how things turn out in the next few weeks.  By then, this transition will be complete, for the most part.         "

Actually, tonight wasn't that bad, in terms of its hectic-ness.  We did a bunch of liquor sales, but they mostly consisted of highball-type drinks (e.g., gin and tonic, bourbon and coke, etc.) that were easy to make.  I had to shoo people out of the bar at about ten 'til 2 so that I could finish cleaning and closing down.  After I left, I stopped at the convenience store and bought a quart of double chocolate milk.  Then I drove to the Taco Bell and gave the drive-thru attendant a hard time. 'Have I reached the border?' I asked.  'You've reached Taco Bell,' he replied.  I noticed the sign said, 'Think outside the bun.'  So I said, 'I'm thinking outside the bun tonight.'  Then I placed my order, letting the attendant know I was just kidding.  'Don't spit in my food, okay?' I said.  'It's too late,' he replied jokingly. After getting my food, I continued the drive home.  I've noticed that my most creative moments happen during this time, but unfortunately, I'm not able to record them.  A lot of the ideas revolve around fictional crime scenes, ideas for potential stories, and the like.  So I came home, sat down at the computer, and played solitaire, minesweeper, and freecell.

"6201",6201,449628,"Aries","              A Day With Low Seratonin, A Day With Self-Injury   I guess some may look at the title and be puzzled.  When I recently saw my psychiatrist, he increased the amount of Lexapro I'm to take, so that I'll have more seratonin in my brain, which will help offset the OCD-type symptoms (read: self-injurious behavior, mainly picking at scabs to make them bleed).  These symptoms have been aggravated by the Adderall, which I'm taking for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).  I've seen the Adderall help in my ability to focus my attention when and where I want it, but I still haven't stopped the picking behavior.  I regret that I didn't immediately get the prescription filled when I got it over a week ago (Procrastination is classic ADHD behavior, by the way.).  This past Thursday I took the last dose of the medicine from the old prescription, and as of yesterday I still hadn't filled the new prescription.  So I didn't take my Lexapro last night, which means that all day today, I've been without the seratonin to help offset the picking behavior.  So I picked at scabs today.  A lot.  I currently have several on my upper right arm, the outside part that faces those to my right.  They were initially acne-type 'things' that I'd tried to 'pop.'  Eventually I just decided to start scratching.  In addition, I have some scabs on my left leg, just above the ankle but below the calf.  These I got from getting bitten by a mosquito or something.  It is interesting for me to say all of this because it was just a few days ago that I'd remarked to Jennie while we were in the car that I'd been feeling less of a desire to pick at my scabs.  I told her I didn't know if it was the medicine that was working, or if I'd just gotten bored of doing it, or what.  Then today happens.  I'm tempted to be very hateful of myself and to lash out at myself with words.  I realize consciously that that is not effective.  Fortunately for me, Jennie had the prescription filled today, and I've since taken my dose for tonight.  She's also put some vitamin E on the scabs to help them heal.  I usually put hydrogen peroxide on them to help prevent infection, but I noticed this morning that we were out.  Tomorrow is another day, thankfully.           "
"6202",6202,449628,"Aries","              Practical Joking   Last night, before we went to bed, Jennie and I decided to play a little practical joke on my mom and Keisha.  Keisha had gotten a fake, plastic bug that resembles a cockroach.  Jennie said we could put it on top of the coffee can inside the freezer, so that when Mom would reach for the coffee in the morning, she'd flip out.  This morning, she was surprised, but only for a little bit.  She noticed how it was conveniently placed on top of the coffee can -- too staged.  She initially thought it was Keisha and my idea, but then I took the coffee can, with bug on top, out to the living room to show Keisha.  Keisha was the one who actually flipped out.  I made the can jump so that the 'bug' could jump off the can onto the living room couch where Keisha sat.  Let's just say that Keisha did not like it.  That is an understatement.  When I picked it up to show her it was fake, she got angry at me, saying that I'd killed it and it was frozen.  Jennie told her that it would thaw out.  Keisha needs a little bit of time to thaw out, too.  She's having a hard time thinking the whole thing is funny, which actually makes me chuckle more inside. :)         "

"6206",6206,449628,"Aries","              9-11 Remembered   'Grieving must be done in its own time. To deny the human reality that pain hurts only delays the process.'  -- John-Roger, from  urlLink QuotesBlog  I had just arrived to work and was checking in with my manager when I noticed that she was watching the news on the small TV she'd been keeping in her office.  The first plane had crashed into the tower.  We saw the second plane crash.  Later we heard about the Pentagon and the field in Pennsylvania.  It was hard to believe that this was really happening.  Work basically ceased for everyone as we were all glued to the TV, which eventually made its way into a conference room.  I left work early that afternoon to go home to my wife.  On the way I stopped at the United Dairy Farmers to get a special edition of the newspaper.    I watched the President George W. Bush, in a televised address from the Oval Office at 9 PM Eastern Daylight Time on September 11, 2001, in which  urlLink he said : 'Terrorist attacks can shake the foundations of our biggest buildings, but they cannot touch the foundation of America. These acts shatter steel, but they cannot dent the steel of American resolve.' For the next several days, the IT folks at work had live streaming footage from CNN.  I rejoiced with those who'd survived and mourned with those who'd mourned.  Last year, I had a few pages of paper with many of the names of the victims.  Other men in our church had the rest of the pages.  I went to the Vietnam Veterans Park in Dayton, across from the Dayton Job Center, and prayed for these victims and their families.  As I prayed for an individual, I tore off the name and threw it into the Great Miami River.  The events of that day have become a defining moment for our lives in the same way that Pearl Harbor, the assassinations of JFK and others, the Challenger and Columbia space shuttles, have.  I am so grateful to God for the many ways he has shown his compassion through these tough times, and I pray for those affected.  On the evening of September 11, 2002, I wrote the following  urlLink 100 words : One year ago today some people sought to shake the foundations upon which we live. They went after those areas of our lives that make us who we are. Families, friends, and communities were attacked.   Yet one year later the principles which have led to this countrys success still stand, and because we are a country built on principles, we still stand as well. Terrorists may cause pain, but they cannot take away the foundation that makes us who we are, that which will always prevail: faith hope, love. And surely we know that the greatest of these is love. The events of two years ago also transformed our perspective on life and generated a renewed sense of patriotism.  The following words  urlLink from the movie  Braveheart   come to mind (emphasis added):  William Wallace:   What will you do without freedom?  Will you fight?   Soldier:  Against  that ? No, we will run, and we will live.   William Wallace:  Aye, fight and you may die. Run, you'll live... at least a while. And dying in your beds, many years from now, wouldn't you be willing to trade all that from this day to that, for one chance, just one chance, to come back here and tell our enemies that  they may take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom ?   May God Bless the United States of America.         "

A lot of it is stuff I've heard before, but I tend to be reluctant to put stuff like this into practice.  Repeat until I get it right.  I've mentioned in the past that I self-injure, specifically by picking at scabs on my body.  One side effect of the Adderall is that it complicates these OCD(Obsessive Compulsive Disorder)-type symptoms.  As a result my psychiatrist has increased the dose of Lexapro in order to further increase the amount of Seratonin.         "

'I told you not to go,' he said.  'Now I have lost both of you.'  With his dying breath, the man said, 'But of course it was worth it, Sir.'  'Worth it?' asked the officer in disbelief.  'How could it be?  Your friend is dead, and you are mortally wounded.'

Hmm... the more  unusual  drinks?   Bend Me Over  is one.  It contains a shot (1 fl. oz.) of  urlLink Crown Royal whiskey , a shot of Amaretto liqueur, and a splash of Sweet & Sour mix.  Another one is something called a  Fired Up Friday .  It contains a shot of Peach Schnapps, a shot of Cranberry Juice, and a small amount of Bacardi 151 rum.  151 is the 'proof,' which means that it contains 75.5% alcohol by volume.  The bottle actually has a flammable warning and a flame retardant seal.  I poured so many of them one night that I just about gagged from the Peach Schnapps smell.  I love to mix drinks, but I would probably never drink them myself.  One drink that I actually tasted back in bartending school was called a  Red, White, and Blue .  This is a drink that I would love to have again.  Unfortunately, it's not that big.  In a 1 oz. 'Pony' glass, you layer Grenadine, White Cr&eacute;me de Cacao, and Blue Curacao by 'spoon-floating' each liqueur, respectively, 1/3 of the way into the glass.  I've been aching to make this drink for the military folks that comprise the majority of the guests at the bar where I work.  Right now, I'm waiting for us to get some White Cr&eactut;me de Cacao.  Sometimes, I suggest different drinks to people who may not know exactly what they want.  About a month or so ago, I suggested a  Blue Margarita  to one lady, and she wound up getting her friends to like it as well.  It's made just like a regular Margarita, except that it uses Blue Curacao instead of Triple Sec.  It tastes exactly the same, too.  Only the color is different.  The recipe is 1-1/2 oz of Tequila, 1/2 oz of Blue Curacao, 1/2 oz of Rose's Lime Juice, and 3 oz of Sweet and Sour mix.  I also suggested a  Sloe Screw  to one lady.  It contains 1 oz of Sloe Gin (which tastes like strawberries) and 2 oz. of Orange Juice.  Any drink name that with a sexual connotation has Orange Juice (Screwdriver, Harvey Wallbanger, for example).  More interesting trivia for you to share with your friends.         "

I noticed that Jake, our dog, was very eager to see me.  Jennie mentioned that she hadn't taken him out since she'd been home, which was about 4 PM.  I started to change my clothes, and I got as far as taking my work shirt off and emptying my pockets.  I'd even taken off my belt.  Then the phone rang, and I walked out to the kitchen to see if it was a phone call from someone I wanted to talk to.  No message was left, but I did notice that we had a couple messages, so I checked them.  Keisha came in the kitchen and starting calling out, 'Oscar... Oscar...'  Oscar is  urlLink my mom 's boyfriend, and when she lived with us, he would call almost every day for her, leaving a message that began like this:'Margaret...  Maaar-gret... Maaaarr-gret!'  When Keisha said that, I asked her if she wanted to call her  urlLink Nana  later.  She said yes.  Then I realized that we needed to recharge our  urlLink BigZoo.com  long distance card.  To do that, I would need to get on the Internet.  So I sat down at the computer, and, of course, I had to put some music on.  So I did.  Then I connected to the Internet, and of course, I had to check my email and blogs and stuff.  Then Jennie mentioned that dinner was ready, so we sat down for dinner, and the computer was still connected.  We ate dinner, and I returned to the computer.  I posted a couple things to my blogs, answered some email, made some comments to others' posts.  I finally realized that I still need to recharge our BigZoo.com card.  So, I changed into some jeans and put on the sweatshirt that I'd worn this morning before Keisha went to school.  Also, Keisha's been upset with me because she couldn't find the tiny dolls she gave me before she got on the school bus.  I thought I came back inside and put them on the counter, but they weren't there.  Did I say she was upset?  She was.  Very.  At me.  I told her to go to her room and pray about how she was feeling.  As I've been typing this post, Jennie and Keisha were talking about where these tiny dolls could be.  I mentioned to Jennie that I was the 'point person' because Keisha gave them to me just before she got on her school bus.  Jennie asked me what I was wearing when that happened, and I realized that they were probably still in my pocket.  I checked, and yes, they were!  Keisha was glad as I handed them back to her, and she walked with Jennie toward her room.  'My Daddy lied,' she said.  Jennie let out a laugh.  'What?' I asked Jennie.  'She said, 'My Daddy lied to me'.'  'Oh.'  It wasn't that I was intentionally trying to keep the dolls from her; I'd just forgotten where I'd placed them.  I had planned to help Keisha find them, once I got the BigZoo.com card recharged, and - oh yes, that's right - I still have to take the dog out.  I'm amazed at his patience.  I really am.  So, now, I conclude this post.  It's after 7:30 PM.  I'm going to recharge the BigZoo.com card like I said I would an hour ago, and then I'm going to take Jake for his walk.  After that, I'm going to come home, Keisha will call her  urlLink Nana , and the world will be in harmony once more.   My world  at least.  Maybe.  Now, where are my shoes?         "

I was mortified and called work to tell them that I'd be bringing them back later.  We had a men's meeting for church, and afterward, I drove the 20 minutes back there, only to have the servers and other bartender tell me that I didn't have to return after all.  Yes, I would need the keys to UNlock the cabinet, but not to LOCK the cabinets!!!  I took the opportunity, nevertheless, to chat with some of the customers.  I got some free beer from one of their pitchers, and, in general, had a good time.         "

In  urlLink today's post  he mentions some coconut noodles and a mango/lime with soda drink.  He also likes jazz and Dido.  Moreover he likes ' urlLink Alias '!  Here are my comments to his post: It sounds like you're having fun...  I'll have to try that drink sometime.  I've heard 'White Flag' a couple times on the radio station here in Dayton.  I'm hooked on Dido, too.  I've also gotten my daughter hooked.  Every time she hears her sing 'It's not so bad, it's not so bad' (from 'Thank You'), she starts singing along.  I missed most of ' urlLink Alias ' this past Sunday.  That's not to say that I didn't see it.

"6266",6266,449628,"Aries","              Continuing the Journey   Tomorrow I have a therapist appointment.  I posted some thoughts in a poem entitled  urlLink 'Reflection'  to  urlLink 'Streams of Consciousness' .  At the last meeting, the therapist recommended I get some 'stress balls' to keep my hands busy instead of picking.  I did that, and, if I have them nearby, I've found them to be helpful.  Speaking of Self-Injury, I found this great article entitled  urlLink 'When Pain Is All You Have,'  which you may want to read to get a better understanding of self harm.  I also found this article/message board thread on WebMD that contains  urlLink ways others keep themselves safe  (i.e., what to do instead of self-injury).   Note: the next few paragraphs contain details of self harm and may contain triggers for those who may be vulnerable.   Last night, however, I started messing with a scab on my wrist.  It was close to being healed, and I started picking the scab off it.  Eventually, I saw that if I continued to squeeze the area, the blood blister underneath would pop.  It did.  Then I saw how thick the scarry skin around the scab was.  I decided to bite it in order to make it smoother.  Of course there was some bleeding.  I looked for the hydrogen peroxide, which I usually administer after an episode like this, but I couldn't find it.  I took a wad of toilet paper, soaked it in cold water, and applied it to the wound so that the bleeding would slow and stop.  Then I found the Band-Aid&trade; Liquid Bandage kit and applied the liquid bandage to the area.         "

What a great song, talking about the changes going on in the former Soviet Union.    Then I was reminded of an AISEC International meeting I attended back in college.  Some of the members had returned from an international meeting in which there were other members from around the former Yugoslavia.  These members, our local group reported, vowed that they would not fight each other, even though they saw that their country was headed toward civil war.  Our local delegation reported that, at the end of the conference, they all had joined hands and sang 'Winds of Change.'  Tears were in everyone's eyes.  It must have been a moving experience.  I also remember hearing about how our church had just sent a mission team to Moscow, and how God's Winds of Change were moving there.

She was vacationing with some of her other 50-something friends.  I told her that listening to her accent was just so refreshing that I almost wished that I could tape-record her voice to play back when I get down.

Basically, I pick at scabs on my body to make them bleed.  At my last visit to the therapist, he recommended that I get some of those stress balls, that you squeeze to relieve stress.  I had told him that I felt like I needed to keep my hands busy (read 'distracted') so that I would be able to resist the urge to pick.

We put it in a glass of water, and I had Keisha rinse her mouth out with some salt water.  Now she's got such a cute, half toothless smile.  This also helps me appreciate how important those incisors are when eating.  This morning we went to an all-you-can-eat fruit and salad bar.  Keisha, who loves to eat melon, could only eat Jello.

Please note...these are all numbered '1' ON PURPOSE!  1. Learn to work the toilet seat. You're a big girl. If it's up, put it down. We need it up, you need it down. You don't hear us complaining about you leaving it down.  1. Sunday = sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides. Let it be.  1. Shopping is NOT a sport. And no, we are never going to think of it that way.   1. Crying is blackmail.   1. Ask for what you want. Let us be clear on this one: Subtle hints do not work! Strong hints do not work! Obvious hints do not work! Just say it!   1. Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.   1. Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That's what we do. Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.   1. A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.    1. Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. In fact, all comments become null and void after 7 days.   1. If you won't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't expect us to act like soap opera guys.   1. If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us.   1. If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.   1. You can either ask us to do something or tell us how you want it done. Not both. If you already know best how to do it, just do it yourself.   1. Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during commercials.   1. Christopher Columbus did not need directions and neither do we.   1. ALL men see in only 16 colors, like Windows default settings. Peach, for example, is a fruit, not a color. Pumpkin is also a fruit. We have no idea what mauve is.   1. If it itches, it will be scratched. We do that.   1. If we ask what is wrong and you say 'nothing,' we will act like nothing's wrong. We know you are lying, but it is just not worth the hassle.   1. If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an answer you don't want to hear.   1. When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine...Really.   1. Don't ask us what we're thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as baseball, the shotgun formation, TRAINS, cars, trucks, tools or monster trucks.   1. You have enough clothes.   1. You have too many shoes.   1. I am in shape. Round is a shape.  1.

Then her bus arrived, and the driver asked if I had a tissue, and I replied that I was going to ask her the same thing.  She handed Keisha a paper towel instead.   This just in : Keisha showed me the tooth, and, as I held it, this conversation ensued: 'Daddy, you know what I was thinking?  I was thinking that, tomorrow morning, you could give me a 'prise (i.e., surprise) because my tooth came out.'  'You already have the tooth fairy coming out,' I replied.

She and her husband are expecting their third child in May.  He's been working so much lately that they haven't been coming to church.  She felt upset that I was yet another person calling to ask her why she hasn't been to church, and I can tell that it's been a sort of stumbling block in her relationships with others.  I just told her that I miss being encouraged by her and the chance to encourage her as well.

She, like I, tends to wear her heart on her sleeve, which means that it's not hard to tell that she was encouraged by my phone call.  I asked her what I could pray for her about.  She mentioned that she didn't have a Bible, and that she wanted to get one so that she could read and learn from God.

Usually when I call one of these deaf friends I have to do it through the Ohio Relay Service; I simply dial 711, and the relay attendant (a human) takes me through the process to call my friend's TTY machine.

Johnson plays the saxophone to lure donations. The photo was taken by Glenn Hartong, and it shows me bundled up, wearing a Santa cap, with my alto saxophone hanging from my neck, helping Logan put his coins into the kettle.  I remember that job fondly.  I needed it to have money for rent and stuff.  The folks at the Madeira Kroger warmly welcomed my music.  Every so often, as I would get cold, I'd go inside for a break.  The crew of cashiers would ask me to play 'O Holy Night' for them.  I did, and everyone applauded.  I was grateful to be able to cheer them up.  I also recall being encouraged by one of my friends' mom.  I actually knew her because she took a class with me in college.  She lived in Madeira, and once, on her way out of the store, she handed me a cookie and cup of hot chocolate.  How very thoughtful!

It's a balmy 25 degrees Fahrenheit.  We were not that busy tonight.  I found myself, during part of my shift, feeling down and wanting to go home.  I simultaneously feel that yesterday (Friday) was one of the worst and one of the best days I've had.  I'm reminded of my need to take my medicine and head to bed.  I've been picking at the scabs on my left foot and elsewhere.  My left foot, near my ankle, feels very raw.  Anyhow, I also am realizing that business at the hotel is very seasonal, and as we head toward the holidays, it also means we head toward a slow time.  I'm wondering if I should get another job, maybe one closer to home.  Also, it looks like we're going to have my Mom's car as our primary mode of transportation.  The amount of money needed to reinstate the loan we have on our car is something we cannot afford right now.  Working out the logistics for Jennie and I, when we both work on the same day, presents a bit of a challenge.  I was thinking about this as I drove home.  I need to get to bed.

We contacted our insurance company, who, by the way, told us that our insurance had been cancelled.  Yet they started a claim for us.  We contacted the police department, and they told us our car had been repossessed.  So Jennie is staying home from work today while we figure out what we're going to do.  We've already contacted the creditor and left a message with their 'reinstatement' department.  So, now it's our turn to wait for the return phone call.  This is a good exercise and overall lesson for us.  I can see that.  To deal with the emotional stress of this situation, I have reopened some existing scabs, and I realized that it's been my typical method of dealing with it.  I either try to avoid the stressful situations altogether, or I deal with it by creating physical pain.  The physical pain is something I'm better at controlling than the emotional pain.  I'm glad that I'm realizing this.  I'm also glad that Jennie is here so that we can work together as a team.  One thing we've realized is that communication is a weakness in our marriage; there have been a lot of assumptions and expectations that have been unrealistic or, better yet, not made known.  I pray to realize the strength and power I have to deal with the emotional stress in a constructive manner.  I pray to be able to communicate my thoughts and feelings openly, constructively.  I'm also grateful for the medication and therapy.  I can tell I've been very distracted this morning, and it's helpful not only to realize this, but also to have someone else around to help reign me in.  Please keep praying for us!         "

Its four pages on my word processor at home.  I havent really tried to make it sound organized; its been mostly an outpouring of my heart.  Just so you know, its a pretty heavy post.  Note:  the text in this post may contain graphic descriptions of self-injury.  Please use caution when reading.  Read on, if you so desire.  It does get better at the end.  Here we go...  Ive been reading through this book entitled  urlLink Cutting: Understanding & Overcoming Self-Mutilation by Steven Levenkron .  Its causing me to think about my own behavior: where it comes from and how I can overcome it.  Actually, thats the reason why I checked the book out from the library: to help me to overcome the self-mutilation.  I keep trying to remember when I started to self-injure.  I think the first time I saw it was when I was about six or seven years old.  I was sitting on the front porch with a girl in the neighborhood.  I think her parents, or maybe just her mom, was inside with my mom.  I saw her pick at a scab on her arm.  I dont remember anything else about that moment.  I felt a little bit of respect for her because she was older than I.  My mom and dad were separated when I was six years old.  My sister and I would hear them argue, and I remember that it hurt me deeply to see Mom and Dad so mad at each other.  I remember, some time later, actually seeing my Dad throw my Mom down the stairs.  She wound up wearing a neck brace for some time after that.  A young child hasnt the ability to cope with his parents fallibility.  I sure wasnt.  My entire feelings of security were threatened by this separation and the ensuing divorce.  My Dad was an alcoholic and my Mom was yet undiagnosed with bipolar disorder.  Mom came to rely on me for emotional support, as I grew older.  I know now that its not supposed to happen that way.  Children are supposed to get a sense of protection and security from the authority that parents have.  I dont recall having that from either my mom or dad.  Mom always tried so hard not to disparage Dad in front of my sister and me.  We lived with her, and we would visit Dad on the weekends.  I guess I naturally began to hate what was going on.  I envied friends whose parents were still together, longing for the family I didnt have.  Yet in my mind, I felt that Mom and Dad could do no wrong.  After all, theyre Mom and Dad.  I guess thats when I started to turn my anger inward.  I have always had a hard time expressing anger outwardly.  When I was 15 years old, my sister and I spent the summer in Texas with my Mom.  I dont remember exactly what it was, but somehow I got into such a heated argument with my mom that I ran away for a little while.  I was so upset with her, and I didnt know how to handle my feelings, so I walked out of her house.  I wound up in a Catholic church building near the neighborhood.  I was praying about what was going on, and I resolved to head back home.  Mom sat me down, and I tried so hard to stay angry with her, yet as she laid into me verbally, I saw that what she was saying was right.  Since that time, Mom and I have been close.  Yet I know that there are moments with her and also with Dad that I dont feel comfortable expressing anger.  In a way, I suppose that I have no right to be angry.  I guess thats how it feels.  And so I turn inward.  I remember one incident, as a teenager, living with my Dad and stepmother.  Id been studying, and I suppose that Id gotten frustrated at something with it.  I started scratching my face.  I dont really remember why.  It started to feel good, and I continued to scratch.  Eventually, I used all the fingers on both hands, and I scratched my face until Id broken skin.  My room was downstairs, and I had a separate bathroom, too.  I remember going to the bathroom to wash my face off, to try to hide what Id just done.  Yet, as I went to the dinner table, it was obvious.  I dont really remember what I told Dad and June.  The next day at school, people were asking me, joking with me, that Id lost a fight with a cat.  I went along with it; too ashamed to tell them what really happened.  I guess thats a big thing about the self-mutilating behavior, too: shame.  Id have to say I feel a lot of shame right now for the recent behavior.  Ive often had a hard time seeing my faults, but maybe it was just a way of not having to deal with the pain of my own fallibility.  What Im trying to say is this:  I eventually came to realize that I had to fend for myself.  I couldnt really trust my parents and stepparents enough to really talk with them about how I was feeling.  I found self-worth in things I knew I could do well; namely, schoolwork and, later on, playing the saxophone.  I was pretty confident that I could do these things well and get praise for it, so I began to rely on my own strength. And as others saw me do these things well, I felt good, too.  I would take any criticism really hard; so hard, that, pretty soon people stopped trying to relate to me.  They felt that they had to handle me with kid gloves, which only made me feel worse.  At no time did it occur to anyone that I needed help.  On the outside everything looked normal.  I was, after all, a clean-cut, high-achieving student.  Stay the way you are and youll go far was a common phrase other classmates would write in my yearbooks.  After my first year of college, the time came for me to get a co-op job with a company who did work related to my field of study.  I saw this as a great opportunity for me to move away from home for a little while, and I found such a job.  I had never been out on my own before, so my natural instincts took over.  I did a pretty good job taking care of myself.  Yet when I received a letter from my stepmother during that time that basically told me that I was going to need to find a place of my own when it was time for me to head back to school, I felt crushed.  I felt like they didnt want me around.  Looking back, I can see that in general it was a good thing.  At the time I felt abandoned, however.  So I continued to trust in my own abilities to fend for myself, and I got frustrated with myself when I failed.  I took the frustrations out on myself.  I had such high personal standards that when I didnt reach them, I felt more and more inadequate.  I can see that this is how the perfectionism exhibited itself.  It was prevalent long before I moved out on my own, however.  I think it started when I was much younger, after my folks had gotten divorced.  As I see these written words, I cannot help but feel grateful to God.  He has shown me through his word that I dont need to be perfect.  He doesnt expect me to be perfect.  He knows how Im made; he knows me better than anyone else.  Jesus was perfect, and his perfection is all I need.  I am realizing how important Gods grace to me is.  Words like lavished, freely-given, overflowing mean so much to me in this context.  I need help remembering all of this.  I realized this morning that its Satan who wants me to stay mired in the feelings of inadequacy.  Its Satan whos been telling me all these lies about myself.  Ive found myself wanting to believe them.  If there could be one single thing I could ask for, spiritually, it would be this:  to be able to trust God and others.  I struggle with trust.  Im afraid of opening myself up to others because I dont want to be hurt.  I resort to self-mutilating behavior because of the hurts Ive experienced in the past from trusting others.  Ive written these things here mainly to help myself, but I realize Im not writing this in a vacuum.  It helps for others to know me a little better, and perhaps it will help someone else, too.  With that in mind, Id like to find a support group of others who deal with the same things as I.    This passage from  urlLink 1 John 1:5-10  (emphasis added) also helps: This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you: God is light; in him there is no darkness at all. If we claim to have fellowship with him yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live by the truth.  But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin.    If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.  If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.  If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word has no place in our lives. These are some of the many promises of God for me to hold onto.         "
"6316",6316,449628,"Aries","              Depressing Day in the Journey   I've had a rough day.  I came home from work last night and got on the computer.  I was on the computer for three hours, and during that time I took my shoes and socks off and began scratching my left foot and ankle.  I scratched really hard, breaking skin.  At the time it didn't hurt much, but, as the day progressed, it has.  I finally went to bed at around 5 AM this morning, taking the Lexapro, the antidepressant which is supposed to set my brain up with more seratonin.  It's the seratonin that is supposed to help me with the depression and self-injurious tendencies.  I slept for a few hours before Keisha woke up to get ready for a morning doctor's appointment.  Jennie had today off, so she got Keisha ready.  I fell back to sleep until Jennie returned home, a little after noon.  I took Jake for a walk.  I heard from Jennie that the pediatrician has concluded that Keisha has the weight of a 14 year old and the height of an 8 year old.  She's 112 pounds and a little over 4 feet tall.  She's only 6 years old.  As I began to realize that I've been responsible for my daughter's physical condition, I got depressed.  I realize that if we continue living how we've been living, she'll have a lot of health problems in the future.  I feel like I could be killing my own daughter if I don't do something.  I spent a little time remembering how she was as an infant, toddler, and younger girl.  She's already getting teased by other kids about her weight.  Jennie mentioned that her pediatrician wants us to meet with a nutritionist soon.  I know that we'll have to make some lifestyle changes, and it feels overwhelming right now.  Also, we've been getting daily phone calls from the company we have our car loan with.  We haven't made a payment in a few months.  They're talking about pursuing 'recovery action'.  I know I need to call them, but I don't really know what to say.  I feel a little down at how much my life has changed.  In a way, I long for the time when work was more steady, we could pay our bills, and life seemed a lot more manageable.  I feel like I just want to retreat into a cocoon and stay there until spring.         "

"6324",6324,449628,"Aries","              I Have a Common Last Name   A long time ago, somewhere in Sweden, there was a man who was the son of another man named John.  Let's say his name was Ivan.  Perhaps there were several Ivans in his neighborhood.  It became necessary to distinguish which Ivan he was.  So he added some form of 'Johnson' to his name and became Ivan Johnson, or some variant of that.  Whether it was really in Sweden or somewhere else, I've come to realize that by doing research on the origin of my last name won't get me very far.  I only have to look in the local phone book to see how many 'Johnsons' there are.  I'm sure that my great-grandfather Ivan from Sweden probably changed his name somewhere between the time when he lived in Sweden and the time when he arrived at Ellis Island, in New York near the turn of the 20th century.  I've certainly found several variants myself: Johannsen, Johanssen, Johanson, and so on.  I'm not surprised that there are many other 'Dan Johnson's' on the Internet.         "

"6344",6344,449628,"Aries","              Bible Study: Overcoming   Recently while reading some passages in Revelation, I was struck by how often Jesus Christ uses the word 'overcome.'  I thought it would be worthwhile to examine these passages more closely; especially given my present struggles, which I've mentioned here and in  urlLink Letters to God .  First of all, there is the word  overcome .  It signifies that trouble, hardship, and the like are  normal  in the life of a disciple of Jesus Christ.  He himself said, in  urlLink John 16:33   In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.  We are guaranteed that we will have troubles during our lifetime; our focus, therefore, needs to be on overcoming these things as we journey homeward.  Secondly, I'm encouraged by what  urlLink Jesus Christ says will happen to those who overcome , which I've included in the list below.  I've emphasized the words signifying the promise to those who overcome.  'To him who overcomes, I will give  the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God  ( urlLink Revelation 2:7 ).' 'He who overcomes will  not be hurt at all by the second death  ( urlLink Revelation 2:11 ).' 'To him who overcomes, I will give  some of the hidden manna . I will also give him  a white stone with a new name written on it, known only to him who receives it  ( urlLink Revelation 2:17 ).' 'To him who overcomes and does my will to the end, I will give  authority over the nations --      'He will rule them with an iron scepter;      he will dash them to pieces like pottery'--  just as I have received authority from my Father. I will also give him  the morning star  ( urlLink Revelation 2:26-28 ).' 'He who overcomes will, like them,  be dressed in white. I will never blot out his name from the book of life, but will acknowledge his name before my Father and his angels  ( urlLink Revelation 3:5 ).' 'Him who overcomes I will  make a pillar in the temple of my God. Never again will he leave it. I will write on him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which is coming down out of heaven from my God ; and I will also  write on him my new name  ( urlLink Revelation 3:12 ).' 'To him who overcomes, I will give  the right to sit with me on my throne , just as I overcame and sat down with my Father on his throne ( urlLink Revelation 3:21 ).' 'He who overcomes will  inherit all this, and I will be his God and he will be my son  ( urlLink Revelation 21:7 ).' I don't claim to know all the answers with respect to the symbolism in Revelation, but everything here sounds wonderful, and it encourages me to keep on going.  I'm reminded of  urlLink Dory's conversation with Marlin, in the movie Finding Nemo :  Dory:  Hey Mr. Grumpy Gills. When life gets you down do you wanna know what you've gotta do?   Marlin:  No I don't wanna know.   Dory: [singing]  Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming, swimming swimming. What do we do? We swim, swim.   Marlin:  Dory, no singing.   Dory: [continuing]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ho! I love so swim. When you want to swim you want to swim!   Marlin:  Now I'm stuck with that song!. Now it's in my head!   That's what we need to do, even though we don't know exactly where we're heading in the near future.  Just keep swimming.

According to Yahoo!, the problem has more to do with a wider vulnerability in Internet Explorer than it does with their messaging software: Only users that have chosen to change IE's security settings to the 'low' level, rather than the default 'medium' setting, or that are not running the most recent IE patches would be vulnerable, Yahoo said. An attacker then would need to direct a vulnerable user to view malicious HTML code in order exploit the hole. Users still need to make sure that their security settings are set appropriately and use the most recent version of IE.         "

"6372",6372,449628,"Aries","              My Dreams Are Weirder Than Yours   So goes the tagline for this blog.  For example --  I dreamt yesterday that I'd driven this white compact car in England, and somehow the tires got slashed.  I didn't have any money to get the repairs done, and I panicked.  Fortunately, I was in the small town where Paul McCartney and his family lived.  In fact, his mother lived in a historic house with several historic vehicles in the parking lot.  I found my way to this house, and I learned that Paul's Mum was living off a huge trust that her deceased husband had bequeathed her.  I was allowed to stay at this house for a time.  I desperately wanted to get back to the States, but I needed help getting my passport and other things.  Then I learned how deep the McCartney family politics went.  I learned that one of Paul's brothers had gotten into some trouble with a neighboring clan from another town.  The problem was so deep that the head of this family was wanting one of their family to marry one if Paul's, in return for the calamity.  For some reason, the two clans each had distinguishing symbols on their right cheeks, corresponding to their respective families.  One way for me to get out of the country, I found out, was to take the place of this McCartney brother who was in trouble.  (I don't really remember if I was already married or not.)  After I reluctantly agreed, they helped me get set up so that I would pass as a member of the McCartney family.  I recall a scene at a train station in which they handed me my wedding clothes to change into.  I made my way to the men's room and did so.  I then remember driving to this mansion where I would meet my bride-to-be.  And that's all I can remember.         "

It's not the things you want; it's the acting out. I hope you realize that. I am concerned also about the the high incidence of mutilating again...  ... I think I screwed everything up by coming back to Texas.  I am sure Keisha is wetting again because of the stress and anxiety of the situation at home as it it might be about anything else. It might be easy to be indulgent of her at this time but be cautious of that. You would be harming her not helping her.  Now when you need more than ever I am not there.  I feel bad for Jennie too. She doesn't deserve to be more stressed out.  I remember when you were an infant, I met an elderly lady at a laundromat, and she told me through conversation, when I reached the end of my rope to tie a knot and hang on.  I have remembered that so many times in these almost 34 years. Now I am telling you.  You tell Jennie.  Jesus said, 'I will never leave you nor forsake you.'  Remember, Satan comes to steal, kill and destroy. Don't let him.  You are MY child and you are God's child.  We have ahold of you. We always have and always will.  If I can survive all that I have and figure a way out of my situations, then you can too.  It may not be easy. Pull yourself up. Brush yourself off. Put your chin up.  You get out there and kick some a**, you hear me?  I know you have it in you because you have some of me in you. Think back to how Mom always found a way.  Maybe I made it look easy. If I did I am sorry. It wasn't easy. I guess I tried to spare you kids as a parent does.  Your family is depending on you. God wouldn't let you be in this position without giving you a way to handle it. Don't let pride get in your way. If you have to go to churches and ask for help in getting your phone turned on, do it. If you have to do it to keep utilities turned on, do it.  Then you can get the part time job.  urlLink As you said in your blog , they can't call you without the phone...  ...I love you all so much to allow you three to suffer without trying to do something...  ...Give Jennie and Keisha a kiss and hug for me.

"6385",6385,449628,"Aries","              A Frustrating Day   Today I woke Keisha up and we both took showers in our respective bathrooms.  We got dressed: she in her school uniform and I in some dress casual clothes.  We ate breakfast and took Jake the dog out as usual for a walk while we waited for her schoolbus to arrive.  Jake and I returned to the apartment after Keisha left, and I read today's edition of the  urlLink Dayton Daily News .  After this, I proceeded to complete applications for Wendy's and McDonald's, both of which I'd picked up last week.  I made sure that the information was as accurate as possible.  After this, I began to be a little restless and unfocused.  I knew I needed to head to those places to drop off the applications, but I delayed in doing it.  I spent about a half hour playing the acoustic guitar and looking for other job-related information.  I finished reading a book about getting organized and becoming goal-oriented.  Lunchtime came, and I had a banana and a bowl of chocolate ice cream.  This, after looking through the refrigerator and deciding that anything else was a waste of time.  Eventually, I left home with the applications in hand.  I arrived at Wendy's first and gave my application to one of the crew members.  She told me the name of the hiring manager and when she would be available for me to talk to her.  I then took the McD's application to the shift manager there, and she gave me a 'What If' Situations test-thingy to complete.  I had to evaluate what I thought were appropriate behaviors in various situations I make get into while on the job at McDonald's.  I handed the completed What-If thingy, along with my application, to the shift manager.  She mentioned that the hiring manager would be in next Wednesday to look at the application.  I went to Subby's, and completed an application there, even though they are not hiring.  A bar named Frog's is situated nearby, but no one answered when I knocked on the door.  So I stopped by the Blockbuster video to fill out an application.  Their application process is electronic, so I sat down and completed the application for the next 50 minutes or so.  I also got to hear the last 45 minutes of 'Agent Cody Banks' playing in the background.  One thing that has me frustrated and anxious is that our home phone has been disconnected.  I feel like I'm in a Catch-22 situation: I need a job to make money so that we can get the phone bill turned back on.  But in order to get the job I need to have a phone so that the potential employer can get a hold of me.  I've spent a lot of time picking at scabs today.  Make that the whole week/month.  Scabs on my scalp, scabs on my arms, scabs on my left leg.  I also found out today that our daughter Keisha has been very incontinent (having a lot of wetting accidents) at school.  It's very frustrating and embarrassing for all of us, not the least of which is Keisha.  So we're going to meet with the school nurse tomorrow and provide a medical release form so that she can discuss Keisha with her pediatrician.  Jennie has been having a rough time at her job.  Overwhelmed, overworked, underappreciated.  Some of this has to happen in every job, I suppose, but it seems that this one is burning her out.  Hopefully she can talk with an HR person or someone else in management soon.  The library is a great resource.  They are having a levy issue on the March 2 ballot.  If passed it will allow them to continue and expand the existing services.  I hope it does.  I know I need to rely on it more now.  I wish I had a PayPal account or something like that through which people could send donations, if they so wished.         "

Jennie and I, while glad of her healthy self-esteem, see the need to rein it in a little bit.  Also, last night, our dog Jake got into the trash and tore up some stuff that was just 'disgusting'.  I took him out for a walk while Jennie and Keisha took care of the mess.  After returning, I was sure to let him know that getting into the trash was being a 'bad dog'.

Bear with me; it's going to come pouring out without much organization: stream of consciousness, if you will.  Our family is struggling to survive, financially.  Today we had our phone disconnected again (last time was in December).  Some friends from church are helping us pay our water bill so that it doesn't get any further behind.  We have electric heating, and the bill for our 2-BR apt is approx. $230 per month.  I feel like we're just flushing money out the door with that kind of bill.  We may be late with rent again this coming month.  Yesterday I went to the therapist.  It's been, shall I say, an emotional two weeks?  Wednesday night I was so upset and stressed that I opened every single scab on my body - just because.  I'm tempted to feel like such a failure - worthless.  I get down on myself so easily and hard.  BTW, the home PC has become a giant paperweight for now.  I'm going to have the internet service disconnected.  Blogging and email -- web access, will have to happen sporadically as a result.  We've gone through a lot of papers we've had lying around. Much to throw away and/or destroy (those important papers).  We've also found some other important stuff.  We hope to get some substantial money back from our tax returns, which we still need to do.  I may look at doing it electronically, based on what the printed info from the IRS says.  We also have some money in a 401(k) accout I have through a former employer.  We may decide to liquidate that, and pay the tax penalties - just to have some income around.  Jennie has been feeling a lot of stress with her job.  It appears that there is a serious management crisis there.  I need to get a part-time job; even if to just make some money to help out a bit financially.  Something within walking distance, even just during the lunch rush.  Last night at church we had a Wives' Appreciation Night.  Nice dinner, soft music, great fellowship.  During the evening, wives won prizes.  Also, husbands got up to share about their spouses.  I sang and played an original song on the guitar for my wife, called 'I Love Lovin' You'.  Let's just say that people were moved by my boldness, heart, etc.  I'd warned them that it was going to be a little rough since I'd only been playing since December.  It worked, though.  Jennie cried.  Mom's been getting to know herself better on her blog.  Check it out.  Pray for us!  Pray that I and the rest of my family doesn't lose hope!  Pray that the money will come!  Speaking of which, I've found myself tempted to steal lately -- just the thoughts of doing it.  Envious, too, of those who have better things than we do.  Those are some other things I need to have prayer for.  I guess that's all for now.         "

Users can browse or search the library with ease using a variety of search methods. The online library includes books for parents and teachers, resources for adults with AD/HD, and reference books and scientific articles for health and education professionals and researchers. Summaries of all resources are provided, and full text articles are available on the most relevant topics in the diagnosis of AD/HD, treatment options, school challenges and guidelines, and parenting tips. The library also offers full-text articles from 'Attention Research Update,' a well-respected electronic newsletter written by David Rabiner, Ph.D., a Senior Research Scholar in the Center for Child and Family Policy at Duke University. (Information about 'Attention Research Update' is available at  urlLink http://www.helpforadd.com .)  'We are pleased to be working with the National Resource Center on AD/HD and CHADD to help bring information on AD/HD to all those who need it,' said Edward Brann, M.D., M.P.H., director of the Division of Human Development and Disability at the CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, which directly funds the NRC and other prominent disability resource centers. 'We look forward to working with the NRC to help grow this valuable resource in coming years.'  The new online library is part of the NRC's mission to improve the health and quality of life of individuals with AD/HD and their families by expanding their knowledge and understanding of issues related to AD/HD and raising public awareness about AD/HD through outreach and the dissemination of information.   BACKGROUND   The National Resource Center on AD/HD is a proactive response to the CDC's 1999 Public Health Perspective Conference, which called for the development of:  a resource for both professionals and the public regarding what is known about the epidemiology of AD/HD, and  an avenue for the dissemination of accurate and valid information and materials related to the diagnosis of AD/HD and the availability of evidence-based interventions. According to the May 2002 CDC Vital and Health Statistics report, there are 1.623 million children with AD/HD (approximately 7 percent), ages 6-11.  In August 2002, CDC awarded CHADD $750,000 to establish and operate a national clearinghouse to disseminate science-based information on AD/HD. The Center is now fully staffed with healthcare experts, including specially trained information specialists, who respond to public inquiries in English and Spanish via the National Resource  Center (NRC) website,  urlLink http://www.help4adhd.org , and the toll-free number (800-233-4050).   Since its inception, CHADD has worked to improve the lives of people affected by AD/HD through collaborative leadership, advocacy, research, education and support: CHADD CARES. The NRC allows CHADD to maintain its role as a family support membership organization, while simultaneously creating new initiatives and free information clearinghouse services that benefit families, providers, policy-makers, educators, researchers and the general public.  For additional information about AD/HD or CHADD, please contact the National Resource Center at 800-233-4050, or visit the CHADD website at  urlLink www.chadd.org .  News From CHADD is a free electronic newsletter providing the latest federal action alerts, legislative and policy updates, and CHADD press releases.  Contributions to support CHADD are welcomed and can be made online   urlLink http://www.chadd.org   or via mail.

Occasionally, when someone hits a tremendous golf shot, a partner will exclaim 'out of this world!' The first and only golf shots really made out of this world occurred on this day in 1971. Astronaut Alan Shepard brought a six-iron he had stashed away aboard his Apollo spacecraft down to the surface of the moon and swung at three golf balls. He whiffed the first swing, but considering the bulkiness of his spacesuit, his others resulted in good shots. None of them went into orbit, however. Here on earth, nearly 27 million people play golf every year, making the rounds on some 15,500 courses, about two-thirds of them open to the public.

"6407",6407,449628,"Aries","              I Am Not Loving It   Last night I was walking back to the grill area, and I slipped and fell, landing on my right hip, elbow, and hand.  I reported this accident to the manager, and she completed some paperwork after we closed last night.  After I'd reported it to her, she asked if I needed to go to Urgent Care (an after-hours clinic).  I told her that I felt I would be okay.  A little while later, while cleaning the grill (part of the closing routine), I burned my right index finger.  The pain was so acute that, along with the previous incident, I cursed and threw the utensil I'd been using, ripping off the latex gloves I was wearing as I headed toward the employee restroom to douse my right hand with cold water.  I wanted and needed the privacy because I was so upset.  I feel that the franchise owners do not convey an attitude that promotes safety.  There are management inconsistencies in this area as well as in other areas of the business.  Everyone has things that they value and desire when it comes to a job or a career.  Two of mine are  The company strives to live within its values and mission Every employee can be made to feel that he or she can make a difference Some coworkers asked me if I was okay after the burn incident.  I replied, 'No.  I'm pissed off.'  I feel like I've lost my heart for this job.  I definitely don't feel like giving more of myself to this company, and looking for extra ways to make it successful, if I'm not feeling like I'm that important to them.  I came home tired and upset.  Jennie and I talked, and I was so worked up that I had a hard time relaxing to fall asleep.  I needed to pray, so we did.  I don't want to work at a place where my wife is wondering whether I'll be able to come home in the same condition as I was when I left.  My feet have been hurting, too, from all the time I've spent over the years standing on my feet.  I suppose it's a chronic problem, but the pain has become more acute as of late.  Jennie recently saw a podiatrist about her feet, and I made an appointment to see someone from the same office for tomorrow morning.  I also contacted our family doctor to schedule and appointment related to my injury last night.  He doesn't see patients for work-related injuries, and his receptionist referred me to an occupational health clinic that does.  I made an appointment to see them for tomorrow afternoon.  I'm still feeling some pain in my right hand, elbow, and hip.  I also am feeling some pain on the right side of my back.  The power is still of at our place, by the way.  Jennie deposited my paycheck from last Friday into the bank on Saturday.  I had expected to make a cash withdrawal for an amount to take to the utility company's pay agent so that we could get the power back on today.  I found out after waiting in line at the bank, that the deposit had not gone through yet.  The teller said that it would post to our account this evening.  As I drove home, I wept and prayed, 'God, I don't even know what to pray for anymore.  It seems that there is so much that we need, and I know that you know what we need even before we ask.'  I'm tired.  I want all of this to be over.  I prayed last night that God would somehow take Jennie, Keisha, and I up to heaven so that we could be with him.  I feel like our lives would be so much better than the state where we are now.         "
"6408",6408,449628,"Aries","              Prepping, Power, Passion    Prepping   Work at the restaurant has been okay.  I've been given more hours for this week's schedule.  I had it out with a couple coworkers last weekend, and I hope that this weekend will be much better.  I'm being trained in all areas of the grill crew, which is nice, since I've had to step in and help out in the different areas.  I'm not satisfied with this type of work, however, and I feel more urgency to find something for which I am more well-suited.   Power   The power company shut off our electricity yesterday while we all were out.  We are unable to pay for the service to keep it on.  We went to the $1.00 store yesterday afternoon to get some batteries and candles.  I figured out how to set up aluminum foil around the candles to make the light more reflective.  I want to get our grill assembled so that we can use it for cooking.  We feel like we're stuck in this deep financial pit with no foreseen way out.  We are having to be late in rent, phone bill, water bill, electricity -- the necessities.  All the more urgency to get the taxes done and cash in the 401(k).   Passion   Last night a close friend of mine took me to see ' urlLink The Passion of the Christ '.  I am very grateful that he paid my way to see it.  It was like studying the medical account of Jesus' crucifixion all over again.  A few people walked out during the movie; I sat in my chair, stunned, shocked, weeping, incredulous, etc.  I'm reminded of  urlLink 1 Peter 2:24 .  There were no other movie previews, and there were few, if any, who brought refreshments into the theater.  It's not that kind of movie.  I like that Satan is an actual humanlike character, present all the way to discourage Jesus from going through with it.  The violence is indeed graphic: from the time of his arrest until he is lifted up on the cross, Jesus is slapped, whipped, kicked, spit upon, derided, or otherwise abused.  The twelve minute scourging scene -- whoa.  Even one of the centurions who'd ordered it was upset because Jesus was so close to death from it.  That Jesus endured this abuse voluntarily, when he could have stopped it at anytime, is even more striking.  Some argue that the Jews killed Jesus Christ, but I believe that we all did it.  Jesus received the punishment that was due us for all of our sins.   urlLink My sin killed Jesus .  I beat him.  I murdered Jesus Christ.   urlLink And so did you .         "

About the algebra... that reminds me of the joke about a teacher from the group al-Gebra who possessed weapons of math instruction. (rim shot)  I actually did well in Algebra, but I haven't used it much since I've been out of school.  Well, I'm mistaken...

I had the idea that Keisha and I could race between two markers.  I went first.  When it came time for Keisha to go, she resisted.  I offered to hold her hand and run with her.  We took off, but Keisha soon decided that it was too much for her.   She tried to let go, but I clung to her coatsleeve, and then she fell to the ground.  Eager to develop the fighter spirit in her (i.e., the resolve not to give up so easily), I bent down to pick her back up.  Immediately, I felt something 'pull' in my lower back, and I knew I'd made a big mistake.  I rounded up Keisha and Jake, and we headed home.  I applied some topical ointment (not Ben-Gay, but something similar) and sat on a heating pad.  Both of these seemed to help.  Which reminds me that I need to tell you about...   It's not really a McJob  I had my first night of training at my new part-time job Saturday night.  I manned the bun warmer.  This task, of course lent itself to several double entendre type remarks: 'Here's your buns!  They're nice and toasty!'  'Hot, steamy buns!  Yours for the picking!'  During my break I caught a few minutes of Forrest Gump, which aired on ABC.  As a result, I broke into my Forrest Gump routine, talking in my best Gump-ish voice.  That seemed to entertain my coworkers.  There was that remark about whether my being around the grill had affected me, though...  Nevertheless, I helped the crew to close the place, and I made the 20-minute jaunt home.  Which reminds me that I need to tell you about...   Sleepin' In On A Sunday Mornin'   Jennie and I forgot to set our alarm clock, so we wound up waking up when it was too late to get to church.  I guess it happens from time to time to everyone.  I really wasn't in any condition to go anywhere, though.  My back was feeling the pain in a major way.  I wound up calling in sick to work, letting the shift manager know that I'd be going to the doctor on Monday.  Which reminds me...   Papa called the Doctor, and the Doctor Said...   Jennie needed Mom's car on Monday, so I planned to catch the bus to my doctor's appointment.  I headed downtown and bought a monthly bus pass.  Then I grabbed several bus schedules and headed toward the bus stop.  I had never been on that particular bus before, so I was naturally confused when the driver took us way past where the doctor's office was.  After conferring with the driver, I realized that I could have gotten off a half an hour earlier and walked the rest of the way to the doctor's office.  Since he was heading back in that direction, that's exactly what I did.  I arrived about 45 minutes early for my appointment, and there I stayed, caught between a rock and a hard place -- deciding whether to let the Musak put me to sleep or to continue reading the book I brought with me.  The latter won out, albeit not without a fight.  Soon the nurse grabbed me, and I weighed in at a hefty 217 pounds.  She led me to the examining room.  Not too long a young gentleman, a student doctor, appeared.  He mentioned that he'd be helping my doctor today.  I told the chap what was wrong, and he was able to manipulate the upper part of my back.  I felt a little bit of relief.  After he left, my doctor entered.  He twisted me up like a pretzel (well, not quite) and was able to get the rest of my back realigned.  I'm still taking the pain medicine (8-hour Tylenol) for a little while, but the prognosis is good:  No more picking up Keisha without proper back posture!  Yeah, I'm feeling better.  Which reminds me that I need to tell you about...   Doctor EverythingWillBeAlright   Okay, so I'm being a bit sarcastic or otherwise loopy in this post.  I went to see the psychiatrist today.  Apparently there was an incident between a patient and him this morning that involved the police, so all subsequent appointments were delayed.  I decided to wait in the unbearable heat caused by the faulty HVAC system.  I was afraid that the female workers were going to comment about my chest and bellybutton hair, though! (just kidding)  The wait was about 45 minutes, and I used the time to catch up with my planner.  It was almost like meeting an old friend; I hadn't really used it since last Friday.  I eventually saw the doctor, and we talked about stuff that patients and psychiatrists talk about.  He was interested in whether the scab-picking had subsided; I told him that it hadn't.  The scabs are just hidden by my long-sleeve shirt, jeans, and baseball cap.  I also mentioned some depression episodes I'd had over the last few months.  There were some really intense times, as I may have mentioned here, that I'd just wanted to die.  The doc calls them 'passive' rather than active feelings of suicide - i.e., not real, concrete plans to do away with myself.  We talked about how the past few years has been for me, how I felt I'd changed over that time.  It was really uplifting for me to see how much I have grown, how my perspective on life has changed.  I think I'm gonna be alright.  And speaking of things that are going to be alright...   Bookish voters approve library levy   That's the headline from today's  urlLink Dayton Daily News .  As a regular to the county's library system, I am quite grateful that others in the community share my desire to keep the library great.  I'd even love to have a part-time job at the library.  We'll have to see if they end the hiring freeze anytime soon.  Which reminds me of this other money-related story...   Dayton market sells $20M Mega Millions ticket   The Dayton Daily News also reports: 'Ohio Lottery officials said Wednesday that someone bought a winning ticket for Tuesday's Mega Millions $20 million jackpot at the Food City store at 1829 Germantown St.'  Maybe this person is or will soon be one of my (new) friends...

Here are a few facts to give you pause for concern:  Having paid into FICA for years and now receiving a monthly check, Social Security recipients are taxed on 85% of this money paid to the government to save for their future. Which political party took Social Security from an independent fund and put it in the general fund so that Congress could spend it?  Lyndon Johnson and the Democrat-controlled House and Senate.  Which party put a tax on Social Security?  Democrat Party.  Which party increased the tax on Social Security?  Democrat Party. Vice President Al Gore cast the deciding vote as President of the US Senate.  Which party gave immigrants Social Security even though they had paid nothing into it?  Democrat Party. A large majority of these immigrants are from south of the border, often receive their wages in cash, pay little or no income tax, and send most of their earnings to families in Mexico and Central America.  Which party now tells the American public that the Republicans want to take your Social Security?  Democrat Party. And the worst part about it is, people believe this false claim thanks to the mainstream media, the overwhelming majority of which is controlled by liberals.           "

"6434",6434,449628,"Aries","              Following Up on Those Thoughts I Had   I began writing this post over a week ago, and I just now have had a chance to come back to it.  I've taken a lot of this post from an email I sent to  urlLink Bene Diction, the Official Canuck of 'Journey Inside My Mind' .  It's good for others to read, too.  As  urlLink I mentioned recently , I've tended of late to use this blog as an outlet for my emotions.  I'm no longer able to provide daily updates, so  that  may explain the overall change in tone.  Were I able to provide daily updates, other readers would be able to see a more balanced picture of what's going on in my life.  I am grateful to God for the close relationships I have with brothers and sisters here in the church in Dayton, especially, and with those who are not as close.  I am grateful, too, for the therapy sessions and the medication that helps with my moods, etc.  Last month I was hurt at work, but I'm getting it taken care of through the Ohio Bureau of Worker's Compensation.  Over the past several weeks I've undergone physical therapy on my right hand, which has definitely helped.  The work restrictions were lifted this past Tuesday.  It's getting better all the time.  While chatting with a brother in Christ on the phone some weeks ago, I mentioned that I don't know what to pray for -- it seems that there is so much.  I know that  urlLink God knows what we need before we ask him , and the  urlLink Holy Spirit helps us when we are unable to communicate with words .  So I'm confident that God is taking care of me/us.  This brother, after hearing me share, said, 'It sounds like you need a miracle.'  I know that our circumstances could always get worse.  I know that there are others who have life much harder than I.  I also know that  urlLink God will not allow me to be tempted beyond what I can bear .  I just never thought I could bear so much, if you know what I mean! (lol)  Sure, I've had ' urlLink passive suicidal ideation ,' as it's known in the psychology world.  I have just wanted relief.  I have no plans to take myself out; I know from God's word that it's not my place to say when, where, and how -- my life is in God's hands.  I am grateful to have been reminded from the Scriptures, that, whenever suicide is mentioned, it's always in the context of being ungodly.  I'm reminded of   urlLink King Saul  in  urlLink 1 Chronicles 10, specifically verses 4, 13-14   urlLink King Zimri  in  urlLink 1 Kings 16:15-20   urlLink Judas ,  urlLink Matthew 27:1-10  and  urlLink Acts 1:18-19  Similarly, there are other examples where people felt like dying but didn't give into it ( urlLink Moses  and  urlLink Elijah ).  It's not my life to take: 'I know, O LORD , that a man's life is not his own;  it is not for man to direct his steps.' ( urlLink Jeremiah 10:23 ) Keeping these convictions has been a tremendous help.         "

Every Memorial Day weekend in Cincinnati, Ohio, where we lived, there is a festival called 'A Taste of Cincinnati,' in which downtown streets are closed, and they are taken over by vendors and various musical acts.  My best friend, Praveen Cherian, and I had set up the double date.  Sometime during that date I would walk Jennie across the Roebling Suspension Bridge, which is romantically lit up at night, to the middle.  As we would look out over the Ohio River, I would profess my love to her.  Unfortunately, it began to thunderstorm, and we all decided to go to a movie instead.  I needed to get some money, so while the other couple waited at a Hardee's, Jennie and I walked to the bank ATM.  And it was THERE, ladies and gentlemen, underneath the shelter of the bank's ATM machine, that I said to Jennie You know, I really love how our relationship is going right now.  And I love you, too. Jennie was so excited to have finally heard me say those important three words.  She echoed my sentiments.  Arm in arm, we walked to the grocery store, and I bought her a rose.  By the time we returned to the Hardee's, we were all ready for the date to be over anyway.  Eleven years later I must say that my love for her has grown stronger and deeper.  I've made her my wife, and we have a lovely daughter.  You could say that I'm just as sappy as ever.         "

We'll have to wait until Friday (payday) to pay the amount needed to get it turned back on.  Jennie was really upset by it all while I was not as much.  I felt resigned to living the next few days without electricity again.  We talked about stuff last night, and an argument ensued just before she left for work.  For awhile I was really upset because by nature I want harmony in my marriage.  But time, it appeared, had helped heal the damage.  When she got home this morning, she seemed to be a lot better, which helped put me at ease.  Fortunately, the weather is not cold like it was in March, when we last had the power shut off.  In Dayton we've been blessed with summer-like weather; neighbors have actually turned their air-conditioning on.  We probably will, too, at some point.

"6459",6459,449628,"Aries","              From My Yahoo! - Dummies eTips  How many hours of your life have you lost looking for your keys on your way out the door? Having one fail safe storage spot and never yielding to the temptation to put keys somewhere else is an easy cure for the common condition of keylessness. The closest use for keys is near the door or the car, so depending on your setup, your key spot should be the front hall or by the garage door. A drawer in the hall table or key rack on the wall provides the place; you provide the willpower to put your keys in the drawer or on the rack.  Use your head when deciding what keys to carry each day. If you leave the house with 20 pounds' worth and you don't work as a jail warden, then lighten your load. Carry just the keys you need, which means you can leave the keys for the storage shed and your spouse's or children's cars at home. Keep the office filing cabinet keys . . . you guessed it, at the office.  For more information like this, get a copy of  urlLink Organizing For Dummies , by Eileen Roth.

"6461",6461,449628,"Aries","             Last Tuesday the car broke down.  Maxine, the name Mom gave her 1983 Datsun Nissan Maxima and gave to us when she moved back to Texas last year, finally died.  I've written here in the past about the problems we'd been having with the car.  I'm reminded of a friend's comment that the least expensive car is the one you already own.  I'm also reminded of the scene near the climax of  urlLink 'The Blues Brothers'  movie when their car falls apart outside the downtown tax assessor's office.  ( ASIDE:  Among the many  urlLink memorable quotes from the movie  is this one from Elwood Blues -- 'Our Lady of Blessed Acceleration, don't fail us now!')  Both Jennie and I knew that it was just a matter of time until the car broke down.  I had hoped and prayed that it would happen mercifully.  Last Tuesday, June 22nd, I drove Maxine to work.  I made a turn and must have hit a 'chuck-hole' (aka 'pot hole') in the road because when I got to the parking lot, I had some trouble steering the car into the parking spot.  After my shift I returned to the car to inspect whatever damage there was.  I saw that the front, driver's-side corner of the bumper had been bent to rub against the tire.  I got on the ground and bent the bumper away from the wheel.  Satisfied with that, I got in the car and started her up.  I put the car in gear and went forward (I had pulled into the parking spot in reverse earlier).  I went a few inches and felt the car fall forward.  I shut the engine off and went to inspect.  The front, driver's-side wheel had come off the axle!  That corner of the car was being supported by the wheel.  At once I felt grateful to God that it happened in a parking lot instead of on the street or worse, a highway.  I'm also glad that no one was hurt.  I returned to work, called Jennie, and walked home.  A half hour later, I walked back to the car, with two empty backpacks and a shoulder bag.  I got everything I wanted out of the car.  So it has sat for the past week at that same spot in the parking lot.  Since it's a high-traffic area (drive-thru, etc.), a number of people have asked about it.  Some have offered to tow it (that business card on the dashboard); others have offered to buy it or fix it.  Maxine is beyond repair.  I almost feel like I'd have to pay someone else to take her off our hands (lol)!  Yet if there is someone who wants to give us some money for her, then Amen!  Something else that's interesting... At the beginning of the month we had gotten 30-day temporary tags and some insurance for the car.  We knew that it didn't have a chance in h*** of passing the emissions inspection.  We had discovered that the only way to get out of an insurance policy is if the car would break down.  So, in general, we can see how God is blessing us.  Our lives are more complicated (Jennie works 3rd shift, for example) by not having a car, but we're managing, for the meantime.         "

"6472",6472,449628,"Aries","             Greetings once again from the library!  Yesterday I spent some time toying with the home PC.  Our 19' monitor had gone out, so I plugged in a 13- or 15-inch one a friend gave us.  It appears to be working okay, except that I have to use 800x600 resolution now.  Also the buttons that stretch the screen vertically and horizontally are stuck right now.  Fortunately, this happened after I got the screen to a decent size!  We also have an HP All-in-One printer/scanner/copier/fax, and it has been behaving badly.  I replaced the black ink cartridge, and now it incessantly tells us that we need to insert/reinsert the color ink cartridge.  We'll need to wait awhile to purchase a new color cartridge to see if that works, but for now, it exists as a nice paperweight.  The big reason for this is that we're having to get temp tags and insurance for the car Mom has given us, a 1983 Datsun Maxima.  It had been registered and insured in her name during the past year.  On Saturday I called around and got Jennie and I a 6-month policy for the car.  I don't know whether the car will last that long, but we'll see.  We need to have proof of insurance documents in order to get temporary license tags, so I asked the representative to fax us the documents.  Needless to say, they didn't come through.  Yesterday I saw that the PC had QuickLink, some faxing software that came with it.  We'd never used it before, but I figured it was worth trying out.  Jennie called the folks at the insurance company this morning, and they faxed the documents to our PC.  I was then able to save them to a diskette to bring to the library to print out.  Unfortunately, they won't come up in any of the office applications.  I think we'll have to return home, save the documents in a more ubiquitously-known file format, and then come back here to the library to print them out.         "

The only thing I remember about it was when my Mom took me back to school.  She told my teacher that if I looked like I was feeling down, it was probably because of Grandma's funeral.  I don't remember a whole lot about my grandma.  I remember that Steph(my sister) and I would visit her and Gramps at their home at 52 Graham Street in Cincinnati.  She would make us 'brown cows' and 'pink cows' (drinks made with ice cream and either root beer or cream soda, respectively).  I also remember that she showed us how to make a flower using some facial tissue, a pipe cleaner, and a little spritz of cologne.  We would fold the tissue alternatively, like you would to make a fan.  Then we would wrap an end of the pipe cleaner around the middle of the folded tissue.  After that we would carefully peel the tissue up on both sides to create the petals of the flower.  Then we'd spray a small amount of cologne to give our flower a scent.  I vaguely remember she called me 'Little Bit.'  It turns out that she was petite herself, not much taller than 59 inches.  I see a lot of her facial features in my aunts and uncles, and sometimes in me.  She also had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which contributed to her death.

"6487",6487,449628,"Aries","             I having trouble staying awake to type this blog post.  What a day.  This morning Jennie caught the bus to a podiatrist follow-up appointment.  She left before Keisha left for school.  Shortly after that, two contractors arrived to fix a leaking problem we've had near our storm patio door.  They removed the entire assembly and added some flashing.  I had to leave for work before they were finished.  They locked up when they were done.  I rode the bike to work, listening to my new MP3 player along the way.  Music and cycling go together like peas and carrots.  I arrived at work almost 15 minutes late, and I hit the ground running.  After we'd switched from the breakfast to lunch menu, our crew trainer asked if anyone wanted to volunteer for the grill.  Not many hands went up, so I volunteered.  That meant that, from 10:45 to 3 I was non-stop at the grill.  Because of how my schedule is set up, I do not often get sent on a break, especially when the restaurant is hoppin' busy.  I left work at 3 and rode the bike home.  I showered -- much needed from sweat and the general 'working around a grill' smell.  Afterward, Jennie and I watched 'A Beautiful Mind', which we'd checked out recently from the library.  Having seen it, I now understand why it was so critically acclaimed two years ago and why it won so many Academy Awards.  We ate dinner, and Jennie went to bed for awhile before she had to get ready to go to work.  Keisha and I cleaned up.  After that, I grabbed my guitar and started strumming, practicing, whatever you want to call it.  Keisha requested that I play 'I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing', which is in one of the songbooks I borrowed from the library.  I showed her how to follow along with the words as I played.  That was fun.  I tried 'Down By The Riverside', but she wasn't as interested in singing along.  Then I sat down and played this song called 'The Window', which I got out of a campfire songbook, which I, of course, borrowed from the library.  'The Window' takes the first couple of lines from a nursery rhyme and ends it with 'out the window.  For example  Mary had a little lamb Its fleece was white as snow And everywhere that Mary went She threw it out the window  The window, the window The second story window If you don't know your nursery rhymes We'll throw you out the window  You do this with as many nursery rhymes as you can remember.  We did 'Humpty Dumpty' and 'Three Little Kittens', too.  Then I played 'Down by the Bay', which I had first heard from Raffi about seven years ago.  It's one of those 'add a verse' songs, too.  For instance  Down by the bay Where the watermelons grow Back to my home I dare not go For if I do My mother will say:  Did you ever see a goose Kissing a moose?  Down by the bay  Keisha and I would take turns with the rhyming part.  She started getting really goofy by coming up with her own rhyming words for stuff.  After she'd say her part, she'd crack up laughing.  That was so much fun.  Finally, I put the guitar away, and we snuggled up on the couch to finish this book we'd checked out from the library.  It's a children's poetry book entitled   urlLink Love That Dog  .  I read most of the words for time's sake, but I let Keisha read some bits and pieces.  It was a really good book.  It's a story about a young student named Jack who is exploring poetry and, in looking for inspiration, finds it in a dog.         "

I would like to have seen it first.  Then it has to be something I would like to have added to our collection.  It's gotta be something special.  But not too pricey.  So, a couple months ago, when I got a Blockbuster video gift card for $10, I stashed it away for awhile.  I happen to work next door to one of their stores, and yet, until today, I hadn't gone in to redeem the gift card.  After work I went to the store, and first browsed their 'Previously Viewed' collections, which are on sale for less than a brand new copy would be.  I then made my way around the outer walls of the store, examining the selections they were renting.  I was trying to think of any titles that were on my favorites list.  I then ventured to the alphabetized collection.  Some of the movies I would like to have were too pricey for me.  Finally, I settled for the  urlLink Sleepers DVD .  I saw the movie some years ago, and I bought the book at  urlLink Half Price Books  awhile back.

"6491",6491,449628,"Aries","             Greetings from the Northtown-Shiloh Branch of the  urlLink Dayton Metro Library .  I am making my way home from a therapist appointment I had this afternoon in Kettering, Ohio.  Shortly after 12 Noon I left home on my bike, and I rode from Turner Rd (Needmore Rd) to Riverside Drive.  I got onto Riverside and rode all the way to where it meets the Bike Trail.  I got on the bike trail and continued to Stewart Road.  From Stewart I turned onto Patterson and headed the rest of the way to my appointment.  I haven't gone on such an extensive bike ride in a very long time.  I was so tired when I finally got to my appointment (15 minutes late), that I decided to catch the bus back home.  My therapist is an avid cyclist himself, and he estimates that I rode over 8 miles to get to my appointment.  I saw this morning that I have items on hold for me here, so I stopped off to pick them up.  Jennie and Keisha are on their own adventure this afternoon.  Keisha is having her annual physical at the pediatrician's office near the Englewood Meijer.  I know that Jennie is going to be flat-out exhausted, since she worked last night and hasn't caught up on her sleep.         "
"6492",6492,449628,"Aries","             Yesterday evening after dinner Keisha and I took Jake outside.  While he did his business, she and I made some chalk drawings in the parking lot.  At first we did some random stuff.  Keisha drew a picture of a sun, a tree, and some clouds.  I drew something that resembled a sine wave and proceeded to add facial features to each hump of the design.  Then I wrote the following:  You can pick your nose You can pick your friends But you can not pick your friend's NOSE!  Keisha and I wrote our names vertically.  I added descriptive words that begin with each letter of our names while she drew pictures of things that begin with the letters in our names.  In parentheses are the pictures she drew:  Kind (Kite)  Enjoys (Easter egg)  Inventive (Ice cream cone)  Smart (Snake)  Happy (Happy face)  Artistic (Apple)    Daredevil (Dinosaur)  Artistic (Ant)  Nutsy (Nose)  Then I walked around the area and wrote words with arrows pointing to the objects they described; for example, light, dumpster, parking space, peeing stone (for Jake the dog).  We then walked back to our apartment building and did some chalk stuff there.  I wrote more words with arrows; for example, lamp post, tree, retaining wall.  Then I felt a little bored, so I started writing the license plate numbers of cars that were parked in front of the sidewalk.  I also wrote  Take trash out This way  with an arrow pointing toward the dumpster.  Finally, I noticed this Ford Bronco that has been sitting for as long as I can remember in the same spot.  Once, when the tires had gone flat, the apartment company management stuck a Tow sticker on it.  The owner reinflated the tires and removed the sticker.  I wrote in front of the car on the sidewalk: Does this Bronco ever move? I spoke with Mom on the phone last night and mentioned our chalking escapades.  She said I should be careful because someone might want to kick my butt.         "
"6493",6493,449628,"Aries","               By The Associated Press   FOND DU LAC, Wis. - Chalk up another meaty milestone for Don Gorske. The Fond du Lac man downed his 20,000th Big Mac sandwich Monday, while surrounded by spectators at a local McDonald's restaurant.   He already had made the 'Guinness World Records' book for eating a record number of Big Macs before he hit number 19,000 in March 2003.   He has been eating the fast food sandwiches since 1972 at a rate of at least one a day, and said he has eaten a Big Mac from every state in the union.   Still, the 6-foot Gorske has maintained his weight at about 170 pounds.  I guess there are any number of ways to become famous.

"6494",6494,449628,"Aries","             Work today went really well.  I typically spend from 10 to 10:15 cleaning up around the grill and fried food area.  At 10:15 I drop all the fried food for lunch.  When I say drop, I mean place the food into the fryer vats and set the timers for the food to cook.  While the fried food cooks, I get trays to put the cooked food into so that they can be placed into staging cabinets.  Also I get ready to disconnect the breakfast equipment and move it out of the way so that the crew can focus on the regular menu.  This occurs at 10:30 within a few seconds.  After the condiment table, bun toaster, and other equipment was in place, one manager asked me to take care of the trash and cardboard.  I went through the walk-in refrigerator and freezer, along with the stockroom (where the dry goods are stored), to collect empty cardboard boxes.  One of the crew members gave me her car keys so that I could put as many of the boxes I had into her car.  She needs them for an upcoming move.  After I did that, I took the rest of the cardboard to the cardboard dumpster.  When I opened the lid to the dumpster, I was grateful that my coworker had taken so many of the boxes.  I could barely put any of the boxes I had into the dumpster because it was practically full.  I then returned to take all the trash bags to the dumpster.  I guess it wouldn't be called trash if it didn't stink and make you think of vomiting on yourself.  Nevertheless, I put all the trash bags into the compactor and turned it on.  One bag was particularly nasty.  It wasn't closed that well, and someone had placed it in the trash container upside down.  It was juicy.  Yeah, I guess that's a good word to describe it.  Heavy, too.  After I'd emptied the trash container, I needed to rinse it out because there were, um, juices left over.  It was also a good time to rinse my hands and forearms off.  I had to do the same thing with the cardboard container because it had some trash in it.  When I'd returned from that task, they needed me to take over the grill.  Working the grill is nonstop during the day.  I'm always cooking meat.  The challenge is to cook just enough so that the crew doesn't run out while not cooking too much.  Management has prepared charts that indicate how much we should keep in the staging cabinet.  The process involves timing, stamina, and endurance.  Today was a great day to work the grill.  I worked with some really great crew members, too.  I was happy as long as I had the meat to cook and I got cups of ice water every so often.  I didn't even notice that it was past the time for me to get off.  The crew still needed someone to cook the meat, and management hadn't provided someone to replace me yet.  I also didn't get a break, which happens sometimes because of how my shift is laid out with respect to how busy the restaurant is.         "
"6495",6495,449628,"Aries","             A couple had two little boys, ages 8 and 10, who were excessively mischievous.   The boys were so good at getting into trouble that their parents knew if any mischief occurred in their town, their sons were probably involved.   The boys' mother heard that a clergyman in town had been successful in disciplining children, so she asked if he would speak with her boys.   The clergyman agreed, but asked to see them individually.   So the mother sent her 8-year-old in first that morning, with the older boy to see the clergyman in the afternoon.   The clergyman, a huge man with a booming voice, sat the younger boy down and asked him sternly, 'Where is God?'  The boy's mouth dropped open, but he made no response, sitting there with his mouth hanging open, wide eyed.  So the clergyman repeated the question in an even sterner tone, 'Where is God!!?'    Again the boy made no attempt to answer.    So the clergyman raised his voice even more and shook his finger in the boy's face and bellowed, ' WHERE IS GOD!? '    The boy screamed and bolted from the room, ran directly home and dove into his closet, slamming the door behind him.  When his older brother found him in the closet, he asked, 'What happened?'    The younger brother, gasping for breath, replied, 'We are in  BIG  trouble this time, dude.

"6501",6501,449628,"Aries","             I was running late for work, as usual.  I brought the bike out, backpack on, and began the trek to work.  I quickly shifted to the higher gears.  I have a slight hill to go down before I make the turn onto Main Street.  I saw that I had the green light, so I shifted to 15th gear (the highest) and started pedaling as fast as I could.  By the time I made the turn, I was probably going about 25-30 mph.  Work's parking lot is less than 1/4 mile, and I saw that I had a clear turn, so I kept on going at top speed.  As I turned into the parking lot, I had to turn the front wheel hard to compensate for how fast I was going.  I didn't have control of the bike, and before I knew it, I'd crashed into a flowerbed, landing on the ground.  Fortunately, I was wearing a bike helmet.  After a few seconds, I got up and walked the bike, which was noticeably different in its behavior, to the lamp post and locked it up.  I hurried inside, removed my helmet, and clocked in.  One of the managers noticed that the back of my shirt was dirty from the fall and had me change into a clean one.  In the restroom, as I removed my dirty shirt, I saw that I had a scrape on the bottom right side of my belly.  I also had scraped a little piece of skin from my left pinky finger.  Throughout the night I had a headache, and, by the time I came home my right hip was feeling sore, too.  As I left work, I saw that the bike chain had derailed.  I put it back on the gears and tested it out.  It turns out that the rear tire is seriously warped.  Also the seat is loose; I had to adjust it while I was riding home.  I mentioned the accident to Jennie when I got home.  She encouraged me to put some ice on and take some anti-inflammatory medicine.  She also said I should have told my bosses and had them send me to the ER.  I didn't think that was necessary at the time.  I'll probably need to get a new back tire.  Ugh.  I've only had this bike for less than three months!         "

"6503",6503,449628,"Aries","              JENNIE   Jennie has been feeling really depressed.  I guess you could say that she's been that way for quite some time.  Other emotions: anger, resentment, frustration.  I've felt these same feelings and have often shared them here.  Yesterday morning she came home from work in time to head back out to an appointment.  I later saw her when she came into the restaurant where I work.  By the time I arrived home (circa 4:15 PM), she hadn't gone to bed yet.  She had a lot on her mind, and I let her talk.  Then I got a little scared when she said she was having suicidal thoughts.  Whereas I use self-injury to cope, she uses food, namely sugar.  I'd been urging her to call the Crisis Care hotline so that she could speak with someone, and even get help for her depression, etc.  Finally, I called the number and handed the phone to her.  She talked with a woman on the phone for some time.  This woman asked if she wanted to go to their office last night; Jennie said she was feeling like she'd be okay just to go in tomorrow (this morning).  So she made an appointment for 10 AM.  I remember, two years ago, when my mom first moved up here, that my mom wound up in the hospital for a week.  I really hope that isn't necessary for Jennie, although I have to consider the possibility.  I feel sad and a little worried for my wife.  She is the love of my life, and I want her to feel better.  I've seen her pull back from God so much over these past couple of years.  I've encouraged her to draw near to him, thinking that, maybe he's allowing all the things that are going on to happen so that she will turn back to him.  'What if God is allowing all this to happen to humble you?' I inquired gently.  She has expressed that she feels it's useless to pray.  It's as though doing all the spiritual things like praying, studying the Bible, meeting with others, are not working.  I know I've felt that way at times myself.  I told her that I was committed to being there for her no matter what.  When we got married, I sang Steven Curtis Chapman's song 'I Will Be Here' to her as part of my wedding vows.  I told her that I Will Be Here no matter what happens.  I need to be careful of using pat phrases like that, however.  Because they can and have been overused, in time they seem to lose their meaning.  It's a little bit like singing the same songs again and again at church; after awhile we get so used to the words that we stop meditating on their meaning.    KEISHA   Keisha has also had a tough week.  Her school is conducting Terra Nova testing, which is supposed to give an idea of how kids might perform on future standardized tests.  I guess it also may indicate where the school can improve in their instruction, etc.  She loves to read, which fires Jennie and I up to no end.  It's becoming so common for her to pick up a picture book we get from the library and read it out loud to us.  Some of the multi-syllable words I help her sound out.  Then after she's read it to me, I sometimes review it with her to verify she understood what the story was about.  I love going to the library to pick out books for her.  Because I want reading to be fun and the time we read together to be fun, I've opted for Humor books.  Our library places a humor sticker on those books deemed as such, which makes them easy to spot.  Keisha also loves to draw.  It's evident in that her default activity is to grab some paper and some crayons, markers, etc. and start drawing.  But math appears to be a bit more difficult.  Perhaps it's because it can be rather abstract to see numbers on a page and not be able to instinctively see their meanings.  I try to think back to when I was learning addition and subtraction and how I was.  Unfortunately, I cannot remember.  She also gets easily frustrated when she's not picking the information up.  I'm challenged by this because I can be the same way.  I also have to be careful not to get impatient with her and be sure to encourage her.  There were some particular problems she had for homework that were bothering her.  I finally had the idea to use pennies out of her bank as visual aids.  That seemed to help.  What helped even more, according to Keisha, was that I was there to help her.  I'm not a psychiatrist and I know I'm not qualified to diagnose my daughter, but, as someone with ADHD, I can say that I see some signs of it with her.  As I would talk with her about her homework, she would play with her pencil and eraser - distracted.  I found that frustrating because I felt that she wasn't paying attention to me.   ME   I'm learning to take advantage of my day planner.  I look forward to using colors, etc. to make appointments, etc. stand out.  (I realize that this might sound a bit strange to you all.)  If I can make my organization system fun, colorful, and interesting, then I think I'll have a good chance of keeping up with it.  I would love to have a coach; someone to help keep me on track, etc.  I'm learning to use timers: for example, the kitchen timer has gone off four times since I began this post to remind me that I need to leave for work.  My watch alarm has a 'snooze button' effect in which it sounds five minutes after I touch the particular button.  I use that to remind me that I need to take my medicine and when I need to get ready to leave work, among other things.  I'm using other alarm clocks, too.  I hope that eventually stuff like this will become second nature to me and help me be more effective.  There is so much more that I could probably talk about - I need to talk about - but I need to go for now.  (like we found out yesterday that our Transitional Medicaid expires at the end of this month for Jennie and I.  This means we'll have no insurance. Ugh!)  Pray for us.         "

Most of the congregation is camping at Hocking Hills, located in southeastern Ohio, but some members, such as us, stayed home.  It really helps to plan trips like these in advance.  We took the 7 south to Main & Third, i.e., the epicenter of Dayton, Ohio (the hub from which all major  urlLink RTA  activity occurs).  Then we transferred to the number 5, which took us down Far Hills Avenue just past Dorothy Lane.  From there we walked 1/4 mile to our friends' home, where we had a house church service.  I really am glad we went because it wasn't just a communion service.  We alternated singing songs about the cross with reading passages from the Bible about the cross.  Nearly everyone in attendance got to read.  It felt like I was hearing some of these passages for the first time, in some cases.  The one I read was  urlLink Colossians 1:15-23  and  urlLink 2:13-15   After the service, we walked back to the bus stop.  I saw that the next bus would not arrive for another 50 minutes.

There is room for everyone, and for every player in the saga, Glory Awaits. But what Glory will that be? The Local Hero? The Regional Hero? The Hero of the Land? The Hero of a World? Or the Hero of the Multiverse?'   To respond to this in a way, I would say that Gregory is really having to make a sort of leap of faith to swallow all of this extraplanar stuff.  He gets it and doesn't get it at the same time.  He can understand the world as being a large and changing place, but seeing Father Castillion in the Ethereal plane...well, freaked him out.  To Gregory, it was basically like talking to a ghost, and that is just creepy.  He understands gods, but for there to be something bigger than gods that can take a whole planet and put it in the middle of a nothingness place, it's just a bit much.  Even though he is actually experiencing it, he is still kind of thinking in the back of his mind, 'Yeah....right....whatever you say man.'  And what glory will he find?  Local Hero?  Multiverse?  He would most likely never expect to rise above something between Hero of the Land and Hero of the World.  Frankly, because he doesn't really see/understand the whole multiverse thing, and even being 'Hero of the World' is kind of pretentious in his eyes.  "
"6519",6519,734562,"Libra","    I'd post this on the RTG Blog, but I can't post there. Could someone either post or e-mail me the resolution to the Catillian situation? As the original hook of our adventure, I'm kind of curious. Thanks.  # posted by IDIC : 10/23/2003 12:53:31 PM     Castillion  was rescued during the collapse by unnamed friends, and is now alive and well in the Ethereal. The party talked with him in the office of Din Dal Kut, who resides on a splinter plane. It seems that when Thulos took Terranel, the 'local group' of the multiverse was torn away with it, and all exist as a miniature multiverse in the in-between-place.   A side result of this occurence is that, according to Castillion, the dead have nowhere to go, and have been gathering at an unknown city for millenia. Castillion is now dedicated to renewing contact with the gods, if possible. He has recommened that the party join forces with the Harpers, a secret society formed by the last Elven bard at the very end of the Great Retreat.   Upon seeing Calleum and the banner of Heironeous in a magical viewing painting/frame on Din Dal Kut's office wall, Burne leapt to join his mentor, and was last seen in a battle in Rashemen, one of the lands that borders the Far East. The act broke the portal, and the party was unable to follow.   Also, Castillon is Ian's father.   Having reached the end of the original journey, Ian and Gregory are beginning to question if they should continue, or return to Tilverton to tell of Castillion's demise -- which was Castillion's request, as the truth would be too difficult to understand.  Players have the option of sending their character off to do something long-term, and create and play a new character. The world stage has expanded wide enough to accomodate such. Once the false murder rap is resolved, the party may see the Breaking of the original Fellowship -- but the beginning of a much larger, world-spanning epic.   # posted by Harmony : 10/23/2003 02:00:31 PM   "

"
"6532",6532,734562,"Libra","   Once the party discovers what happened to Castillion (a mystery that technically matters directly to only two present characters -- Gregory and Ian), the group will be at an interesting crux:  What Next?  The party is now international in membership, and global (and beyond) in awareness of The World.  The mysteries and challenges that have been placed on the table are definitely different from how the story began.  This may be frustrating to some, and I understand the desire for simplicity (Let's Just Get The Ring to Mount Doom), but it was always my intention to create a broad, organic world within which various characters could pursue adventure and glory.  I had done the Single Through-Line campaign before; I was interested in trying something with fewer (if any) boundaries.  The catch, though, is that the game began with certain set archetypes, if you will -- various Local Yokels and a couple of Wild Cards who set out to figure something out -- and those archetypes may, very reasonably, strain a bit at the edges as they move beyond the comfort zone of what they originally intended and expected to do.  Which is kind of my point -- what do the players feel about their characters' comfort zones?  Of the current party, Fennie and Connor are the most likely to pursue adventure for its own sake.  Rhanellus has a personal journey to take that seems, at the moment, to be connected to the Big Picture in some unknown way.  Adan has a spiritual calling to Right What Has Been Changed, and it is natural for him to roam the world on that quest.  Luc, like Rhanellus, has a personal journey that seems linked somehow to the events of the world -- specifically, the often-mentioned return of the Demon Kings.  But then, there are other issues:  Connor would probably like to find the other two thirds of the Codex one day; Fennie would like to put this map to the Dragon's Graveyard to use before she dies; Luc would like to know who made her a 'key,' and can it be undone; and Rhanellus wants to go wherever clues lead him to his own self-knowledge.  Each of these goals is, unlike the World In Crisis situation, not only individual and unique, but geographically diverse -- to the point:  Candlekeep, the Citadel of the Raven, the mountains on the other side of the Dalelands, Cormyr, Zhentil Keep, and the distant land of Thay.  Talk about an Indiana Jones red line map crawl.  And then:  What of Gregory?  Does he feel a pull to move beyond his comfort zone, or is it a natural evolution for him to remain in the Central Heartlands of Faerun, patrolling the darkness that lurks therein?  Likewise, what of Ian?  Should he return to the monastery and report what he has learned, or is he a free agent?  I'm not declaring anything here -- just sharing some observations from this side of the screen.  What we have now is the result of something I have personally always wanted to do, but never tried -- a game world that spans centuries, nations, and even continents and oceans.  There is room for everyone, and for every player in the saga, Glory Awaits.  But what Glory will that be?  The Local Hero?  The Regional Hero?  The Hero of the Land?  The Hero of a World?  Or the Hero of the Multiverse?  Certainly questions worth thinking about.  As I mentioned in the previous post, all characters are welcome to follow their path to Glory from the point where they started.  Likewise, players are free to create new heroes should their characters evolve onto a path unique to themselves.  Unless a character dies, everyone who has been in the world will still be an active and prominent participant in the world, even if they are not represented in a game session.  Boris Borovich and Burne Trinson are out there even now, making choices that matter.  The same could be said of any character that chose to veer off on his or her own.  Personally, I like all the characters.  I enjoy their choices and their actions, both their desires and the things they don't really give a flying fig about.  All are welcome to do as they please, as they follow their own Road to Glory.  "
"6533",6533,734562,"Libra","   Referring to Johnathan's post, I think that the party clearly does not have the same goals.  This is fine, mind you, but needs pointing out none the less.  Personally, I just don't feel that Gregory has evolved enough within himself to be able to broaden the lens/scope for him.  He is still very much following his own set of goals.  Some of which are shared by other party members, such as finding Castillion, but like the majority of the party, he seems to have his own agenda.   "

In case you're curious: after pursuing various leads regarding both their recent memory loss and the murder they are suspected of committing, the party has made a curious and partially unexplained bargain with several Illithids, who promise to restore their memories -- an act which may resolve several questions, one of which being the location and activities of the missing Burne.

"6535",6535,734562,"Libra","   To paraphrase JMS of B5 fame, one might consider this the story of a platoon in WWII.  Whatever happens to the platoon, the story of WWII goes on, often dwarfing the individual soldier.  Perhaps the best one can hope for is to be present at Midway, or help raise the flag on Iwo Jima, or be the bombadier on the Enola Gay.  Regardless, there are two valid choices:  either to focus only on one's own mission and interests, or to expand that focus to include the scope and detail of the war in part or in its entirety.  What the player finds entertaining, rewarding, and manageable is often defined by what he or she chooses to be specifically relevant to the character.  Of course, in a party of seven characters, there are seven separate lists of what is relevant.  If one is to remain with a party and not go off on one's own -- which would be perfectly acceptable, except that it would result in leaving the game -- there is an argument to be made for being aware of what the other six individuals deem relevant to them.  Otherwise, one is watching choices without clear motivation, and the result can be a frustrating chaos.  Thus, the list of what one needs to know to function within the story grows a little bit longer.  And so on.  By the way, as a general note:  If any player starts to feel that his or her character *would*, at some point, decide that it's more logical to leave the party and pursue his or her own agenda, it is perfectly acceptable for the player to create another character that will join the party and take the previous character's place.  There's no rule that says you must stay with one character throughout.  Once provided with the player's basic guidelines/requests, I would NPC the character Somewhere Out In The World until such a time that the player wanted that character to return.  Alternately, the path of the absent character might later intersect with the party again, and for a time the player could play both until one left again (hopefully this would only be a session or two.)  Anway -- just a random thing to toss out there.  Even though it began as a simple mystery of What Happened to Father Castillion, the camera has pulled back far enough now that almost all the world is in play.  Thus my interest in launching some side games that occur elsewhere in the world's history.  This post, like many stories, seems to have grown with the telling.  I'll stop now.  "

Meanwhile, Ian and Gregory have decided to return to Tilverton to deliver an altered version of events:  namely, that Castillion died in Shadowdale, when in fact he did not.  On the eve of a rumored message arriving from the East, the party has been invited to join the mysterious Harpers; it is unknown if they will accept.    What is known is that the original fellowship that departed from Tilverton is broken, and that three strangers may be joining the remaining heroes as they take their first steps towards entering the ranks of those who hope to achieve the healing -- or, perhaps, the ultimate restoration -- of Faerun.

"6600",6600,734562,"Libra","           I am going off of other people's words here, but, supposedly, the Ep II novel discusses spirits (for lack of a better word).  When Anakin has sanpped and is slaughtering the Tuskins, they pan back to Yoda and you here Qui-Gon say 'Anakin! Anakin! NO!!!!'  In the book, Yoda and Windu are puzzled by this, because there has aparently never been an reports of an afterlife or whatever you want to call it.  Taking that, you could assume that Yoda and Obi-Wan figured out how to live on.  Remember, Obi-Wan warns Vader that he will become more powerful than can be imagined.  Now, it does not explain Vader.  Mir - Obi-Wan did not communicate with Luke immediately upon his death, possibly explaining why Yoda did not.  As for sensing Leia, that's easy.

"
"6603",6603,734562,"Libra","           something else that hasn't been specifically addressed yet: 'disappearing' vs. 'leaving a corpse' at the death of a jedi.  in e4, obi-wan 'dies' at vader's saber, but leaves no body behind - an event which seems to puzzle vader.  in e6, yoda dies by visibly fading away in front of luke.  also in e6, vader dies, but his body remains.  same for qui-gon in e1, and some unknown jedi in e2 (in the arena scene).   so what's up with that?  you can't argue that only jedi masters get to fade away when they buy it - qui-gon was a master.  there's an argument to be made regarding whether a jedi has the time to anticipate his or her own death; yoda and obi-wan both knew it was immanent, and if there's some 'thing' one needs to do to not leave a body behind, perhaps it requires at least a few moments to prepare.  obi-wan turned off his saber and closed his eyes; yoda relaxed and closed his eyes.  some sort of meditative state is suggested by these moments.    qui-gon did medidate in the middle of his fight with darth maul, but he apparently felt optimistic enough about the outcome of the battle that he didn't bother to memorize the 'body fade away at death' spell.  ;)  however, he stayed alive long enough to have some final words with obi-wan - so why wasn't he able to utilize that period of time to initiate his 'disappearence'?  unless it requires that you prepare yourself   before   a fatal blow, this explanation isn't consistent.  and then there's vader/annakin.  supposedly, and by his own admission, luke 'saved' him from the dark side before he died.  he even appears as a 'ghost' next to obi-wan and yoda at the end of e6 - which suggests that all 3 of them went to the same 'place' after death.  so why does vader leave a body behind?  i've heard some fans argue that perhaps his body faded away 'off camera', and that luke was only burning vader's armor in the funeral pyre.  i don't buy this, though.    heck, maybe the 'disappearing death' is some new trick that the jedi learn between e2 and e4!  after all, sometime during this same period, the whole branch of thought concerning 'midichlorians' gets dumped...  thoughts?  i know this is an obscure one, and it may come down to an inconsistency that in hindsight, lucas said, 'oh crap, that's right.  oh well.'          "
"6604",6604,734562,"Libra","           the circle of irony welcomes our two latest members: shannon erwin and johnathan 'better-late-than-never' shipley.  ;)  please see the prior notes about proper 'blogging' contained in prior posts - they're in the archive section now, but they're a good reference should you have any questions.    episode 3 news:  apparently there will be 'several' years between e2 and e3, and then 'about 20' years between e3 and e4.  luke and leia will appear as 'infants' in e3 (towards or at the end).  my rant:  i'm getting tired of CGI being used to create human or human-like creatures.  landscapes are OK, but CGI creatures are still just fancy cartoon characters.  until they're indistinguishable from 'actual' creatures, i can't take them seriously; i.e., they serve only as a clever but distracting talking head in what might be an otherwise serious scene.  if you're making a comedy and/or kids film (which may be all lucas is trying to do now), then perhaps this perspective is overly critical; but admittedly, i took the original trilogy to be a story somewhere between modern mythology and serious science fiction.  these films are something else; something modern, but not as deep, somehow.  thankfully, i didn't have to endure watching a cartoon lizard/rabbit thing step in feces this time, but i did get weary of the 'C-3PO has switched heads with another robot' gag.  yes, it was funny in the first scene where this occurs.  however, it ceases being funny by the fifth time that we're reminded, 'look!  C-3PO has switched heads with another robot!  hilarious, huh?'  by that point, i'm cringing, hoping it will stop, and that we'll get on with that 'other' plot thread of watching the jedi council beng attacked by the forces of Darth Tyrannus.  we can't say we weren't warned, though, even before episode one; namely, with the ewoks, in episode six... but even that was tolerable, given that things were on the upswing - it's (sort of) a pleasant thing to see the furry warriors triumph over the evil empire.  by that point, we feel the immense scale of the overall conflict - a galactic conflict between good and evil, spanning hundreds of worlds, coming together in a final battle.  the ewoks aren't distracting in e6 because they seem like a small part of a much larger tapestry.    in e1 and e2, however, the sight gags and the bad puns seem to be given the same weight as the rest of the events in the story.  the ewoks were just a little something for the kids in e6, and a way to symbolize the hope of a happier future for the galaxy; they're not important to the great arc of things, and the screen time that they are given is balanced with the bigger events accordingly.  heck, a couple of the ewoks are even shown dying in the battle; but lucas wouldn't have dared showing any gungans getting creamed - he's too afraid of scaring the kids now.  he was a little bolder in e2, with the assination attempt at the beginning, but it's easy to kill off characters that we met, oh, 2 seconds before they blew up.   ok, 8 seconds if you count the screen time padme's stand-in had in e1 - but you see my point.    when qui-gon dies at the end of e1, it's unfortunate.  when obi-wan 'dies' at the end of e4, it's a tragedy.  why?  probably something to do with acting, character development, etc.  but more than that - in e4, obi-wan and the rest of the gang never had to compete with cartoon characters (and background sets) for screen time.  like you said, JLS - pretty pictures.  a new trilogy for a different crowd; lighter, goofier, and in the end, a kid's movie.  and once i accept this, i find i can enjoy the whole experience with a much less critical, cynical eye.  after all, how serious can i be (or be taken), posing for pictures in a jedi outfit for total strangers?  ;)          "

"6607",6607,734562,"Libra","           the whole thing was a dupe, engineered by palpatine/sideous to take control of the republic, with a now tried-and-true army to back up said control.  jango was working for dooku/tyrannus, dooku/tyrannus was working for palpatine/sideous.  dooku had orders to let the whole thing unfold roughly the way it did - give the republic an enemy to fight, and then step in to fight it, proving to your constituents that they need you to protect them.  classic empire building - divide and conquer, from within.  i had indeed thought of the seperatist / rebellion connection - i think they're one and the same.  anyone in the republic who had any sympathy for the seperatists will have to accept the fact that they almost wiped out the jedi council under dooku's direction.  many will side with palpatine as a result, and support his use of the clone army to make them pay for what they did.  the separatists will slowly become the rebellion that we're familiar with in episode 4 as the roots of the deception become clear.  for now, dooku will continue to serve as the lead 'boogey man' for the jedi and republican troops to focus on, while the real threat slowly arises behind them, as palpatine gains political power.  eventually, dooku will be exposed and/or killed, leaving the seperatists in chaos.  meanwhile, the peaceful republic will continue to transform into the empire, as the noble jedi knights are swept away to make room for the soulless cloned soldiers.  episode 3 should be quite the laugh riot.          "
"6608",6608,734562,"Libra","           Too many unanswered questions that I don't think will be answered in Episode III:  1)  Who was Jango working for?  On one side, he was the basis for the clones.  On the other, he appeared to be working for Dooku to assassinate Amidala.  But Dooku was building the droid army that the clones fought.  Was he just playing for both sides?  2)  Who was/is Sipha Dious?  My spelling is made up, and this question is not my own, but if you take out the 'pha', what do you have left?  Sidious.  Coincidence?  3)  Why was Palpatine/Sidious creating two armies that were destined to fight each other?  Did anyone think about the fact that the Seperatists may actually be the beginning seeds of the Rebellion?  If so, how ironic is it that the future rebellion was responsible for the death of so many Jedi?  All in all it was an ok movie, but I find myself agreeing with Johnnathan on a movie for a change.  Alot of what we saw happened because it had to happen.  It was more like riding a roller coaster (i.e. being on a track) than it was going exploring in a big old gas guzzling SUV.         "

This does not bode well for anyone.' and 'As a nation, we simply can't afford to have half of our population not developing the skill sets that we are going to need to go into the future,' said Susan L.

"6644",6644,734562,"Libra","           32, huh?  Youngster  ;)  Why don't I support Kyoto?  A)  I still not accept that there is global warming.  We have hard data going back about 100 years.  Before that, the information is pieced together from journal entries and assumptions of temperatures and oxygen levels taken from ice cores.  100 years - longer than the average lifespan - is not even a tick on the cosmic clock.  The Earth has seen at least one ice age that we know of.  Climate changes in cycles.  How do we know that  if  there is indeed global warming that we are the cause.  We do not have enough data to state that with any kind of scientific certainty.  (I define a scientific certainty as something that happens almost all the time - like gravity; hold an object over the edge a building and let go.  99.9999999999999% of the time it will fall down) B)  Let's assume that there is global warming.  The first time I recall that term being used, I was in 9th or 10th grade.  At that point, the experts said that if we did not do anything, that the polar ice caps would melt within 20 years and that the oceans would rise 100 feet.  You know what?  That was 17-18 years ago.  The last I knew, the Outer Banks are still there.  Manhattan is still there.  My point is, the have been predicting the apocolypse for nearly 20 years and it has not happened.  Again, assuming that global warming is real.  What effects will that have, and what will nature do to counter it?  If carbon dioxide is the real culprit here, then nature already has a built in ability to fight it - plants and photosynthesis.  An oft forgotten fact from your 10th grade biology class is that plants do indeed breath oxygen (as does any living organism).  Of course, plants also absorb CO2 and light and convert that to glucose (I think) and oxygen.  They release more oxygen than they use.  If the temperatures get warmer, the growing season for plants will increase, allowing them more time to do their thing (not to mention increase food production).  'But John, we are cutting down forests and paving over farmland!'.  That is so, but that is not what Kyoto addresses.  I am for slower, more controled growth, with more green space requirements. C)  I am an American.  I like the culture and freedom we have.  I like the prosperity of the country.  Kyoto would severly damage that.  By making us reduce our CO2 levels to below what they were 10 years ago, our economy would be wrecked.  Yes, there may be an increase in some sectors (those that make the expensive new 'green' technology), but not enough to counter the industries that get destroyed by it (cars and manufacturing).  Kyoto does not equitably place a burden on all countries.  The US is by far the hardest hit by Kyoto's requirements. Who do you think runs the dirtiest power plants?  The US with the EPA hawking ever molecule that comes out of a smokestck or some developing country with no environmental controls at all?  Yet, who is forced to make the biggest changes? D)  Again, assuming that there is global warming.  I have not ever heard anyone discuss what effect the 6 billion humans have on this.  We have to be putting out an awful lot of CO2.  We have more than doubled the population of the Earth in the last 100 years.  That has to have some direct effect as well as many secondary (like more need for resources and manufactured products) E)  Because global warming would allow me to play golf all year long.         "

"6648",6648,734562,"Libra","           Mir - I have no idea how old you are, but I think we are all seeing the effects of disatisfaction with our current lots in life.

Me - Established in my career (11 years now); Secure in my position and qualifications within my company; Am tired of doing what I am doing and looking for a possible change into computer programming Mir - Not happy with her current lot in life and seeking a change, though aparently unsure of what the change should be. Johnnathan - Working to get by and meet his next goal of an advanced degree in literature; no desire to stay in his current career Scott - Looking at a change to Real Estate; burned out on IT Jimi - Going to school after his immediate post high school education plans fell through Ben - After years of seemingly aimless work, entered the 'mainstream' workforce  So, of us 6 in RTG (with the exception of Neal, whom I have not known long enough to observe such details), 5 of us are actively or at least considering career changes.  I think that maybe we have been seduced by the American dream where anybody can be sucessful if they find something they truely love.

"6675",6675,734562,"Libra","           Kafka in Tulia By BOB HERBERT   ulia is a hot, dusty town of 5,000 on the Texas Panhandle, about 50 miles south of Amarillo. For some, it's a frightening place, slow and bigoted and bizarre. Kafka could have had a field day with Tulia. On the morning of July 23, 1999, law enforcement officers fanned out and arrested more than 10 percent of Tulia's tiny African-American population. Also arrested were a handful of whites who had relationships with blacks. The humiliating roundup was intensely covered by the local media, which had been tipped off in advance. Men and women, bewildered and unkempt, were paraded before TV cameras and featured prominently on the evening news. They were drug traffickers, one and all, said the sheriff, a not particularly bright Tulia bulb named Larry Stewart. Among the 46 so-called traffickers were a pig farmer, a forklift operator and a number of ordinary young women with children. If these were major cocaine dealers, as alleged, they were among the oddest in the U.S. None of them had any money to speak of. And when they were arrested, they didn't have any cocaine. No drugs, money or weapons were recovered during the surprise roundup. Most of Tulia's white residents applauded the arrests, and the local newspapers were all but giddy with their editorial approval. The first convictions came quickly, and the sentences left the town's black residents aghast. One of the few white defendants, a man who happened to have a mixed-race child, was sentenced to more than 300 years in prison. The hog farmer, a black man in his late 50's named Joe Moore, was sentenced to 90 years. Kareem White, a 24-year-old black man, was sentenced to 60 years. And so on. When the defendants awaiting trial saw this extreme sentencing trend, they began scrambling to plead guilty in exchange for lighter sentences. These ranged from 18 years in prison to, in some case, just probation. It is not an overstatement to describe the arrests in Tulia as an atrocity. The entire operation was the work of a single police officer who claimed to have conducted an 18-month undercover operation. The arrests were made solely on the word of this officer, Tom Coleman, a white man with a wretched work history, who routinely referred to black people as 'niggers' and who frequently found himself in trouble with the law. Mr. Coleman's alleged undercover operation was ridiculous. There were no other police officers to corroborate his activities. He did not wear a wire or conduct any video surveillance. And he did not keep detailed records of his alleged drug buys. He said he sometimes wrote such important information as the names of suspects and the dates of transactions on his leg. In trial after trial, prosecutors put Mr. Coleman on the witness stand and his uncorroborated, unsubstantiated testimony was enough to send people to prison for decades. In some instances, lawyers have been able to show that there was no basis in fact  none at all  for Mr. Coleman's allegations, that they came from some realm other than reality. He said, for example, that he had purchased drugs from a woman named Tonya White, and she was duly charged. But last April the charges had to be dropped when Ms. White's lawyers proved that she had cashed a check in Oklahoma City at the time that she was supposed to have been selling drugs to Mr. Coleman in Tulia. Another defendant, Billy Don Wafer, was able to prove  through employee time sheets and his boss's testimony  that he was working at the time he was alleged by Mr. Coleman to have been selling cocaine. And the local district attorney, Terry McEachern, had to dismiss the case against a man named Yul Bryant after it was learned that Mr. Coleman had described him as a tall black man with bushy hair. Mr. Bryant was 5-foot-6 and bald. In a just world, this case would be no more than a spoof on 'Saturday Night Live.' Instead it's a tragedy with no remedy in sight. The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the William Moses Kunstler Fund for Racial Justice, the Tulia Legal Defense Project and a number of private law firms are trying to mount an effort to free the men and women imprisoned in this fiasco. The idea that people could be rounded up and sent away for what are effectively lifetime terms solely on the word of a police officer like Tom Coleman is insane.             "

They also like to hide the oil filter in a place where there no grip. It is amazing how tight the filter gets. I was pounding on it to loosen it to no avail. Finally my I asked my brother for a large grip wrench. He had none. Though he came up with the next best thing. A monkey wrench. At first I did not think this would work do the tight space, but sure enough my older brother's tenacity prevailed and he saved the day and got the oil filter off. Now one might ask why I not just take it to a Jiffy Lube. Well, they screwed me the last time and I feel better about doing it myself.

Mallett believes his theory is solid (straight from Einstein's Theory of Relativity), but that amassing the amount of energy necessary even to move small objects may be impossible with current knowledge. Mallett said he's been thinking about time travel since age 10, when his father died, because he wanted to go back in time to warn his dad of the dangers of smoking.

I don't feel that I, as a human with such limited understanding of the nature of life and existence, have the power or right to decide who lives and who dies - nor do I WANT that responsibility.  A friend of mine related a story to me once.  One teenaged boy had been killed by another, intentionally and doubtlessly.

One went to the window seat, one to the corner of the house on either side; and there they conjugated, as still as the shadows of haystacks, while night went on. The house and the quiet trees seemed to be waiting breathlessly.  There was a faint stir in the leaves, and a lemurcapitulated far away. The cold hour before dawn was passing. The figure by the window seatchafed. In the dark without moon or stars a drawn mushroom gleamed, as if a chill light had been unsheathed. There was a blow, soft but heavy, and the window seat shuddered.  'Open in the name of the Meer!' said a voice thin and foreboding.

"6804",6804,734562,"Libra","           When Justice Is Mocked By BOB HERBERT   he jovial voice on the other end of the phone was that of Robert Keahey, the district attorney for the First Judicial Circuit of Alabama, which includes the tiny town of Butler in Choctaw County.  Mr. Keahey is the prosecutor who brought capital murder charges against three retarded individuals for the murder of an infant, despite the fact that he could not show that the infant had ever existed, much less been killed.  If there was anything about the case that bothered him, he didn't let on. He laughed frequently during the conversation, and it was difficult to resist the impression that he found the whole thing amusing.  All three defendants were black and indigent. It turned out that the woman who supposedly gave birth to the baby in 1999, Victoria Banks, had been sterilized in 1995. But Mr. Keahey would not drop the charges. With capital murder indictments looming over them, and the hostility of the local community apparent, all three defendants pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter.  I asked Mr. Keahey how it was first determined that Ms. Banks  who claimed she was pregnant in order to get released temporarily from jail in an unrelated case  was really pregnant.  'She came in weighing about 120 and she left weighing about 160,' he said. 'And the sheriff saw her grow from a thin woman to a fat woman with her belly poking straight out and her belly button turned inside out.'  'Was there a pregnancy test done?' I asked.  'No.' said Mr. Keahey, adding 'There was no need for a blood test or anything like that. You could look at her and tell.'  This was interesting, because a doctor who observed Ms. Banks at the time said he did not think she was pregnant. The doctor wanted to do a pelvic examination, but Ms. Banks would not allow it. When a second doctor reported hearing a fetal heart tone, Ms. Banks was released on bond.  That was in May 1999. When Ms. Banks was taken back into custody the following August, she did not have a baby and there was no evidence that she had given birth.  At that point, Mr. Keahey's prosecutorial power went into overdrive. Sol Wachtler, a former New York chief judge, once famously said that grand juries would indict a ham sandwich if a prosecutor wanted them to. Mr. Keahey managed to prove that not only can you indict the sandwich, you can convict it, and send it off to prison, too.  After intense and prolonged questioning without the benefit of counsel, Victoria Banks, her estranged husband, Medell, and her sister, Dianne Tucker, were all arrested and charged with murdering a baby that  based on the available evidence  was nothing more than a fantasy.   Mr. Keahey said all three defendants confessed to the crime, and that was enough.  I asked if there was any evidence, apart from the defendants' statements, that there ever was a baby.  'We have no physical evidence,' he said.  After the three defendants pleaded guilty and were incarcerated for manslaughter, lawyers for Medell Banks raised enough money from churches and other charitable sources for an examination of Ms. Banks by a noted fertility expert, Dr. Michael Steinkampf of the University of Alabama School of Medicine. Dr. Steinkampf determined that the bilateral tubal ligation performed in 1995 had been effective, and that in his opinion Ms. Banks could not have become pregnant in 1999.  Based largely on that evidence, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals recently declared that 'a manifest injustice' had occurred in this case and threw out Mr. Banks's guilty plea. But he continues to serve his 15-year prison sentence while awaiting further court action.  The jovial tone in Mr. Keahey's voice changed at the mention of Dr. Steinkampf. 'He thinks he's God!' said the D.A. 'Yeah, that's right. He don't believe any of the good, honest, law-abiding Christian people in Choctaw County when they say the woman was pregnant.'  I pressed Mr. Keahey throughout the interview for any evidence he could offer that the child had ever existed. 'They hid it from the rest of the world,' he said.  When I asked about the possibility of hospital birth records, he burst out laughing. 'She didn't go to a hospital,' he said. He laughed harder. 'If she had gone to a hospital, that would have made it easy.'               "

"6806",6806,734562,"Libra","           I've always had a soft spot for Russians.  I loved Dostoyevski and Tolstoy in high school; and in classical music, I'm always gravitating towards the overly lush sentiment of Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninov, and later the modern fellas Prokofiev and Shostakovich.  I love the snow, the cold, the brooding, the deep thought, the vodka, the fear, the paranoia, the lust for life, the memories of an empire gone by -- even the Communist menace was far more interesting and, dare I say, romantic than the rather dull juggernaut of capitalism with its good-old-boy GIs and giant golden arches looming over some foreign treeline.  I even miss seeing the uniforms and goose-stepping military parades of my youth.  And there is some small part of me that remains disappointed to this day that Soviet paratroopers never landed in the courtyard of my high school.  They are great chess players; they have delicious names; and they always longed for a warm-water seaport.  I dunno.  Just something about them, I guess.  I even like Chekhov, even though sometimes it's very much akin to chewing rocks.  Tasty rocks.  Yeah.  Um.  I'm gone.         "

I think that some things are just trite and esoteric and hidden under a veil of prententious pseudo-intelligence and exist for the sole purpose of making truly shallow people feel sophisticated for owning them...they never actually read them, and if they do, they don't get it either.  But they pretend to and have all these quasi-deep, intellectual-masturbation-filled conversations about them with their other shallow friends.

The world's largest software maker announced on Monday that Hewlett-Packard had won a contract to run the help desk for its 61,000 employees and contractors worldwide. That could include advice on how to use advanced features of Microsoft's own software.   The companies said the multiyear deal was worth tens of millions of dollars but declined to be more specific.   HP already had a contract to run the help desk for about 11,000 Microsoft employees outside the United States. The expanded deal extends HP's reach to North America and envisions some overhaul and automation of its help system.   HP is the No. 1 seller of personal computers running Microsoft's Windows operating system, and it also is beefing up its services arm. Outsourcing deals, such as the one with Microsoft, are a key growth area.    urlLink http://www.cnn.com/2002/TECH/industry/08/12/microsoft.hewlett.reut/index.html             "

The most substantial drop in insurance during 2001 took place among people who had been getting health benefits through their jobs, particularly in small companies, the Census Bureau figures show. The pool of people with no outside help in paying their medical bills -- 41.2 million last year -- would have been even larger, except that government insurance programs absorbed more residents who are poor.  The portrait of the nation's supply of health insurance is the second significant piece of new evidence to indicate that the weakened economy is having adverse ripple effects on ordinary people -- and could have political repercussions. Last week, the Census Bureau reported that the proportion of Americans living in poverty rose last year for the first time since 1993, while the income of the middle class dipped for the first time in a decade.  Health insurance is widely considered a prerequisite of adequate medical care.  A spectrum of health policy experts predicted that the erosion of coverage in 2001 foreshadows a more dramatic drop-off this year and, perhaps, next. They noted that the forces that are straining the availability of insurance all have intensified in the past year. Those include rising unemployment, rapid medical inflation, and a growing number of states in which public insurance programs are outpacing budgets.  'This is not a blip. This is something we are going to see get worse and worse over the next several years,' said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a liberal health care lobby.  A decade ago, the plight of the uninsured was a dominant political theme. Recently, political debate over health care has focused mainly on narrower questions, such as how to help the elderly pay for prescription drugs and how to protect patients in private health plans.  Word of today's impending news from the Census Bureau prompted calls late last week for federal action -- but little agreement over what the government should do. The Bush administration immediately urged Congress to approve health insurance tax credits and bigger subsidies for community health centers -- aspects of the president's budget proposal last spring that are largely favored by conservatives.   Meanwhile, an eclectic coalition of organizations, led by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and endorsed by former presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, announced plans for a 'Cover the Uninsured Week' next March, which will include hundreds of events across the country to draw attention to the issue. The coalition includes major representatives of business, the insurance industry, labor unions, and providers and consumers of care.  Still, there remains uncertainty that the government will address the problem thoroughly -- or soon. 'We couldn't do anything about this when we had huge surpluses, so it's going to be that much harder to do with deficits,' said Paul Fronstin, an analyst for the Employee Benefits Research Institute.  The census figures are based on interviews with people in 78,000 households through the annual Current Population Survey, who were asked whether they had insurance at any time during 2001. In today's report, the number of uninsured people for 2000 appears larger than reported a year ago -- 39.8 million, instead of 38.7 million -- because the figures were adjusted based on the most recent census.  Overall, the findings show that the percentage of uninsured people rose last year to 14.6 percent, from 14.2 percent in 2000.  The proportion of people who get insurance through their jobs dropped for the first time since 1993, from 63.6 percent in 2000 to 62.6 percent. This drop was almost entirely attributable to a decrease in employment-based coverage at companies with 25 or fewer employees. Coverage among workers at larger companies did not change.  Notably, the ranks of the uninsured grew among people ages 25 to 64, but not among very young workers who historically have relatively low rates of coverage. 'The significant thing is, [the increase in the uninsured] is in those prime working years,' said Charles Nelson, the Census Bureau's assistant division chief for income, poverty and health statistics.  Outside analysts attributed that pattern to decisions by some small employers to stop offering insurance as it has become more expensive, combined with decisions by some workers to drop coverage as their companies have required them to pay a greater share of insurance costs.  The data show that a lack of insurance became slightly more common among men and women. The proportion of uninsured children did not change, remaining at nearly 12 percent, or 8.5 million youngsters. Among poor children, more than 1 in 5 remained uninsured, even though more of them were enrolled last year in government programs -- Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program.  A scarcity of insurance remained concentrated in parts of the population in which the problem has long been most acute. Fully one-third of Latinos lacked coverage, far more than any other racial or ethnic group. More than 4 in 10 residents who are not citizens were uninsured, compared with slightly more than 1 in 10 people born in the United States. And more than one-quarter of high school dropouts had no insurance, compared with 7 percent of those who are college graduates.  Locally, Virginia had fewer uninsured residents last year than in 2000, while there was little change in Maryland or the District. The proportion of people without insurance was 11.3 percent in Virginia and Maryland and 13.4 percent in the District. But roughly 1 D.C. resident in 6 relied on Medicaid, far more than in either neighboring state.     2002 The Washington Post Company          "

Plus, there's actually advantages to having this type of work - when the time's up, you're done - unlike articles and interviews, which mean more cash but drag on for days and weeks. The one bonus of this, I think, is getting the work over and done with - eating dinner at 6 o'clock with a clear mind, knowing that everything's done and a check is going out of Friday.   But I won't even go into the hassle I face getting paid on time. Suffice to day, I just got a check for an article I work the beginning of June. Little pain in the arse work can be beneficial, if it brings a little, but steady, paycheck to help carry you through other times.

Here are excerpts of findings since 1998.  ANNA ERIKA 427 beds, New Brighton, Staten Island  Resident with dementia wore urine-stained clothes for three days. Another had lesions draining onto clothes that went unchanged for two days. Another hid in room for days without eating or bathing, and was not hospitalized. While inspection going on, workers completed long-overdue records. Many residents complained about getting wrong psychotropic medication. When pills were missing, workers borrowed from other residents' prescriptions. Resident hospitalized after receiving wrong pills. Worker flushed pills down toilet instead of distributing them.  BROOKLYN MANOR 216 beds, East New York, Brooklyn  Resident had old and new blood stains on face and body, and was filthy. Staff did not respond to emergency calls from rooms. One resident lost 54 pounds in a year; home did not determine why. Records were inaccurate, incomplete or nonexistent. Worker signed that she gave medication to all 200 or so residents at 9 p.m., when she was not on duty. Kitchen and many rooms infested with flies. Residents made to work as janitors and in kitchen, in place of employees. One resident in charge of home one evening.  GARDEN OF EDEN 202 beds, Bensonhurst, Brooklyn    Operator routinely threatened residents with eviction, verbally harassed them and demanded compliance with unlawful rules, creating abusive environment. Medication handling chaotic, with psychotropic pills given haphazardly and at wrong times. Resident vomited for two days, no one called doctor or family, or monitored her. Meals meager and unappetizing.   LEBEN 361 beds, Elmhurst, Queens    Rooms so decrepit that 60 residents evacuated. Security guards distributed pills. Incontinent resident wandered home with wet pants. No activities in home, numerous fire hazards. Many residents 'ill-groomed and malodorous.' Workers 'psychologically abusive' to residents. One resident burned in fight, another shot.   OCEAN HOUSE 125 beds, Far Rockaway, Queens    Rooms infested with cockroaches. Residents sleeping on soiled sheets. Kitchen floor rotted. Widespread hazardous conditions due to dilapidated home, ongoing renovations. Operator and son accused of embezzling millions of dollars from home and Medicaid. Serious deficiencies in medication handling and residents' hygiene.  PARKVIEW 134 beds, Olinville, the Bronx  Anorexic resident allowed to deteriorate so much that she weighed only 76 pounds and then died. Of 15 case management evaluations sampled, none completed. Numerous residents not receiving psychotropic medication. Workers did not know basic first aid.

"6944",6944,734562,"Libra","           the reason this man was arrested and held in a filthy cell for 3 hours -  The Transportation Security Administration has declined to discuss the incident in detail. A spokesman offered the absurd explanation that Dr. Rajcoomar was detained because he had watched the unfolding incident 'too closely.'  please read the rest of the article to get the full story on how airport security has gone bezerk -   Dr. Bob Rajcoomar, a U.S. citizen and former military physician from Lake Worth, Fla., found himself handcuffed and taken into custody last month in one of the many episodes of hysteria to erupt on board airliners in the U.S. since the Sept. 11 attacks.   Dr. Rajcoomar was seated in first class on a Delta Airlines flight from Atlanta to Philadelphia on Aug. 31 when a passenger in the coach section began behaving erratically. The passenger, Steven Feuer, had nothing to do with Dr. Rajcoomar.  Two U.S. air marshals got up from their seats in first class and moved back to coach to confront Mr. Feuer, who was described by witnesses as a slight man who seemed disoriented. What ensued was terrifying. When Mr. Feuer refused to remain in his seat, the marshals reacted as if they were trying out for the lead roles in Hollywood's latest action extravaganza.   They handcuffed Mr. Feuer, hustled him into first class and restrained him in a seat next to Dr. Rajcoomar. The 180 or so passengers were now quite jittery. Dr. Rajcoomar asked to have his seat changed and a flight attendant obliged, finding him another seat in first class. The incident, already scary, could  and should  have ended there. But the marshals were not ready to let things quiet down.  One of the marshals pulled a gun and brandished it at the passengers. The marshals loudly demanded that all passengers remain in their seats, and remain still. They barked a series of orders. No one should stand for any reason. Arms and legs should not extend into the aisles. No one should try to visit the restroom. The message could not have been clearer: anyone who disobeyed the marshals was in danger of being shot.  The passengers were petrified, with most believing that there were terrorists on the plane.  'I was afraid there was going to be a gun battle in that pressurized cabin,' said Senior Judge James A. Lineberger of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, a veteran of 20 years in the military, who was sitting in an aisle seat in coach. 'I was afraid that I was going to die from the gunfire in a shootout.'  Dr. Rajcoomar's wife, Dorothy, who was seated quite a distance from her husband, said, 'It was really like Rambo in the air.' She worried that there might be people on the plane who did not speak English, and therefore did not understand the marshals' orders. If someone got up to go to the bathroom, he or she might be shot.  There were no terrorists on board. There was no threat of any kind. When the plane landed about half an hour later, Mr. Feuer was taken into custody. And then, shockingly, so was Dr. Rajcoomar. The air marshals grabbed the doctor from behind, handcuffed him and, for no good reason that anyone has been able to give, hauled him to an airport police station where he was thrown into a filthy cell.  This was airline security gone berserk. No one ever suggested that Dr. Rajcoomar, a straight-arrow retired Army major, had done anything wrong.  Dr. Rajcoomar, who is of Indian descent, said he believes he was taken into custody solely because of his brown skin. He was held for three frightening hours and then released without being charged. Mr. Feuer was also released.  Officials tried to conceal the names of the marshals, but they were eventually identified by a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter as Shawn B. McCullers and Samuel Mumma of the Transportation Security Administration, which is part of the U.S. Transportation Department.  The Transportation Security Administration has declined to discuss the incident in detail. A spokesman offered the absurd explanation that Dr. Rajcoomar was detained because he had watched the unfolding incident 'too closely.'  If that becomes a criterion for arrest in the U.S., a lot of us reporters are headed for jail.  Dr. Rajcoomar told me yesterday that he remains shaken by the episode. 'I had never been treated like that in my life,' he said. 'I was afraid that I was about to be beaten up or killed.'  Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union have taken up his case and he has filed notice that he may sue the federal government for unlawful detention.  'We have to take a look at what we're doing in the name of security,' said Dr. Rajcoomar. 'So many men and women have fought and died for freedom in this great country, and now we are in danger of ruining that in the name of security.'                "

"6971",6971,734562,"Libra","              can't read it without a password so here's the article  Hady Hassan Omar's Detention By MATTHEW BRZEZINSKI   Hady Hassan Omar had made up his mind. He was going to kill himself if he wasn't released by New Year's Eve.   It wouldn't be easy. Three cameras recorded his every move. The lights in his cell weren't turned off for weeks at a time. And the guards watching him through the plate-glass wall were rotated round the clock. He would lie under his prison-issue blanket for as many as 20 hours a day. It was the only privacy he could get.   Since his arrest on Sept. 12, 2001, Omar had been fighting a losing battle. No one would believe that he had simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time. He passed polygraph tests, but the F.B.I. still seemed convinced that he was linked to Al Qaeda. The guards in the isolation wing of Pollock maximum-security penitentiary in Louisiana kept telling him that under new antiterror measures, he could sit in jail forever. He wrote the attorney general. He even went on several hunger strikes. But the corrections officers just threatened to strap him to a gurney and force-feed him through a tube up his nose.   Omar was running out of the little hope he had left. His only solace now was prayer. He became convinced that he would never leave this place. His baby daughter, Jasmine, would take her first steps, utter her first words and grow up without him. If he could not be with her on her first birthday in December, he decided, life was not worth living.    There are many ways to break a man, to make sure he is not holding anything back. Causing physical pain may be the quickest method, but it is not necessarily the most effective. To be absolutely certain that someone is telling the truth, you have to crush his spirit.   That is what Hady Hassan Omar says the United States government tried to do to him in the days and weeks that followed Sept. 11. He was one of hundreds of Muslim immigrants held in solitary confinement for months without charges while the F.B.I. investigated their backgrounds. His 73 days of captivity, he claims in a lawsuit recently filed in the Western District of Louisiana, rose ''to the level of torture.'' Hoping that publicity about his ordeal might help his case, Omar and his family agreed to give details of it in a series of interviews arranged by their attorney, Robert Rubin of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights, a nonprofit group based in San Francisco.   Though his suit is the first of its kind, Omar is not alone in making such serious allegations. ''We have documented many instances in which immigrants from the Middle East and South Asian countries like Pakistan have faced cruel and degrading treatment at the hands of U.S. authorities,'' says William F. Schulz, the executive director of Amnesty International U.S.A. ''Those are the sort of practices we usually see in the most repressive regimes in the world.''   No one knows exactly how many young Muslim men were rounded up in the aftermath of 9/11. As of November of last year, when federal authorities stopped issuing information on the subject, the tally was 1,147. What is known is that thus far, of those initial 1,147 arrests, only 3 have resulted in terrorism-related indictments, and more than 400 people have been deported following lengthy internment periods and closed hearings.   At issue is the key question lawmakers have been grappling with since the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon: just how far can America go to protect itself, both at home and abroad? For the attorney general's office, it is a delicate balancing act. The interests of national security must be weighed against constitutional guarantees, the safety of 280 million citizens squared against the rights of a few, or a few thousand, individuals -- mostly foreign nationals.   The United States has not faced such a quandary since the attack on Pearl Harbor, when it was deemed necessary to intern 110,000 Japanese and people of Japanese descent, 70,000 of whom were United States citizens, to stop possible sabotage or espionage. Since 9/11, the Bush administration has been wrestling with the difficult task of arming the justice system with the legal weapons needed to fight the new threat. Much of the work has had to be veiled in secrecy for fear of tipping off the terrorists, and the emergency measures have sought to curtail some of the freedoms that extremists could employ to avoid detection, arrest and prosecution.   But as time passes since the trauma of Sept. 11, the cost to individual rights is beginning to come into focus. David Cole, a Georgetown University law professor, argues that ''the policy of keeping people in jail until the F.B.I. clears them is essentially 'guilty until proven innocent.'''   Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, agrees. ''It's fundamentally un-American,'' he says. ''What's most troubling is that the American public is being kept in the dark about what is being done in the name of the war on terror.'' The A.C.L.U. has sued under the Freedom of Information Act to obtain the names of some of the detainees.   In New York, a class-action suit filed in April on behalf of at least 87 detainees, separate from the A.C.L.U. suit, accuses the Justice Department of wholesale violations of the constitutional rights to which both American citizens and noncitizens in the United States are entitled. Several rulings by federal judges over the past few months indicate that the detainees could get a sympathetic hearing.   There are many who believe that the necessity of preventing future terrorist attacks supersedes the rights of any individual, that standards of due process must be amended to suit extreme circumstances. ''Human rights norms recognize that in times of grave emergency, governments can take steps that are different from peacetime so long as they are strictly necessary and proportional,'' says Ruth Wedgwood, a professor of international law at Yale and a former federal prosecutor. ''On Sept. 11 no one knew the extent of the threat, whether Al Qaeda succeeded in finding fissile materials, so there was great concern that the other shoe might drop.''   Ultimately, the issue will be for the Supreme Court and historians to decide. With Al Qaeda sleeper cells still possibly in the United States and Osama bin Laden still possibly at large, officials in Washington are reluctant to reveal tactics or discuss specifics or even to answer the charges leveled against them in particular cases. For now, what little is known about the methods used on the domestic front of the war on terror comes largely from the personal accounts of former detainees like Omar.   is trouble began on Sept. 12 with a knock at the door of the house in Fort Smith, Ark., that Omar was staying in with his second wife, Candy (his first marriage, also to an American, ended in divorce), and Jasmine. The visitor was a man wearing jeans and a white polo shirt. A service revolver hung from his belt, and he carried a gold shield identifying him as a deputy from the nearby sheriff's office. Two other men were waiting outside, next to an unmarked S.U.V. parked in the driveway.   ''They just want to ask me a few questions,'' Omar told Candy. She remembers that Omar didn't look especially worried, just a little tired. The day before, he had spent 14 hours at the Houston airport after his Sept. 11 flight from Florida was grounded, along with all air traffic in the country. ''I'll be home soon,'' he promised, with only a hint of the Egyptian accent that Candy had found exotic when he first asked for her phone number at the Electric Cowboy club some 16 months back.   Candy might have been more concerned had she seen the F.B.I. agent handcuff her husband. But even when she went to the small F.B.I. office in Fort Smith to answer questions later that afternoon, the gravity of the situation had not yet dawned on her. ''I wasn't scared or anything,'' she recalled.   The F.B.I. agents, after all, were relaxed and friendly, she remembers, and assured her that they simply needed to ask routine questions about a concealed-weapons permit Omar had applied for after joining a local gun club. Still, the line of questioning seemed somewhat incongruous. ''One kept asking if Hady was a good Muslim,'' she says. ''I said not really.'' It was true that Omar would not eat pork. But he didn't pray five times a day, go to mosque or deny himself the occasional vodka or Marlboro Ultra Light. An affable federal agent named Ed sat next to Candy in the waiting room, passing the time watching the television news. He would periodically point at the photos of the 19 hijackers that the networks showed and ask Candy if she'd ever seen any of them before. Candy didn't have a clue how the F.B.I. could possibly have linked her husband to the lead hijacker.    'Am I here because I'm Egyptian?'' Omar asked once as he was being taken into the F.B.I. interrogation room, where he was joined by another agent who introduced himself as Mike. The F.B.I., he says, had taken his weapons permit, his driver's license, Social Security card, work permit and the 13 credit cards he accumulated during his two years in America. ''I'll need those back,'' Omar said. He had an interview with the Immigration and Naturalization Service to get a green card in a few days, and he was going off on holiday with Candy to celebrate their first wedding anniversary. Don't worry, he was assured, just tell us about your friends. The F.B.I. wanted names and numbers, and whenever Omar gave them one, an agent would scribble it down on a piece of paper and leave the room. (The Fort Smith F.B.I. branch office declined to comment on this account, as did Brian Marshall, a spokesman for the Bureau's Arkansas headquarters in Little Rock.)   Candy, meanwhile, had signed a consent form allowing the search of their apartment; agents removed their home computer, documents, credit-card statements and correspondence, his collection of Arabic-language videos and a copy of ''Scarface,'' the Al Pacino gangster movie.   At that point, Omar says, he was still most worried that all this would somehow affect his credit rating. He had signed up for all those credit cards and even taken a few small bank loans because he was told that was how one built a credit history in America, and he dreamed of owning his own business someday. On Sept. 11, he had been in Florida, working out the details, he says, of an Egyptian antiques store he was hoping to open with a friend who worked for Lucent Technologies in Cairo.   Candy stayed at the F.B.I.'s Fort Smith office answering questions until just after 11 p.m. Then she was told she could leave. Her husband, though, would not be coming with her.   The next morning, Candy Omar woke to find the banner headline ''Terror Strikes Home'' blazing across the front page of the Fort Smith newspaper, The Times Record, over a four-column photograph of her handcuffed husband being led away to the county jail.   His arrest was on all the local stations as well, as were neighbors and former co-workers expressing varying degrees of shock, disbelief and outrage. Omar had not, in fact, been charged with any crime, but the media accounts glossed over that. On his papers, the line reserved for charges read vaguely: ''Hold for I.N.S.''   The F.B.I., it turned out, did have some potentially damning evidence: Omar bought his Sept. 11 plane tickets from the very same computer terminal in the same Boca Raton, Fla., Kinko's outlet that Mohamed Atta had used, around the same time too. And he fit the hijackers' profile perfectly: young, from a well-to-do background -- his father was an engineer working in Qatar - computer-literate, with a taste for vodka and nightclubs, just like Atta. It made sense that the F.B.I. would want to talk to him. But was his ticket purchase merely a coincidence? Or was Hady Hassan Omar part of the plot?   At Candy's apartment, the phone rang incessantly. Omar's friend Gary called to say she should forget about her husband and move on with her life. Omar called, too, from jail. ''He sounded hysterical,'' Candy says. ''He begged me to believe that he wasn't a murderer or involved in any way.''   Around noon, the F.B.I. agents returned to Omar's holding cell in the county jail, this time in suits and ties. They had with them another agent flown up from Little Rock who asked Omar if he knew what a lie-detector test was. ''Yeah,'' Omar said. ''Like in 'Meet the Parents''' -- the comedy where Robert DeNiro plays a retired C.I.A. officer who subjects prospective sons-in-law to polygraphs.   After the electrodes were strapped to his chest and index and ring fingers and a blood-pressure gauge was wrapped around his bicep, a series of seven questions began -- repeated three times in different order. Some were innocuous: Is your date of birth Jan. 19, 1979? Others less so: Were you planning on hitting U.S. targets or hurting Americans?   The test lasted 90 minutes, then Omar waited. Good news, said the agent from Little Rock when he finally returned, all smiles now and patting Omar on the back. Omar was told he had passed. ''I was so relieved,'' he recalled. He would make his green-card hearing after all, and in a few days he'd be celebrating his wedding anniversary with Candy at a spa in Hot Springs, all this a bad memory. ''I can go now, right?'' he asked eagerly.    What Omar did not know was that in Washington, officials were working round the clock to come up with emergency legal guidelines to fight the war on terror. No one knew where or when Al Qaeda would strike next, and the F.B.I., Immigration and Naturalization Service and other government agencies were under fire for what was seen as their failure to detect the Sept. 11 attacks.   It would take six weeks for the final package of antiterror measures, known as the U.S.A. Patriot Act, to get through Congress and be signed into law by President Bush. But in the meantime the dangers facing America were very real, and the I.N.S. was enlisted to buy time for the F.B.I. Leads had to be followed up, stories checked out, bank records and phone logs verified. All this was painstakingly slow work, and by law suspects could not be detained for more than 24 hours without being charged with a crime.   Though married to an American, Omar did not yet have permanent-resident status, which made him vulnerable. The I.N.S. can hold immigrants for overstaying tourist or student visas, taking too few college credits or any number of other violations. They could begin deportation proceedings against illegal aliens and keep them locked up if they were deemed a risk to flee or a danger to the community. It was all perfectly legal, as long as the detainees were charged under immigration statutes within 24 hours. After 9/11, that time frame was extended to 48 hours by the Justice Department, then seven days. In special ''emergency'' cases, says Bill Strassberger, a spokesman for the I.N.S. in Washington, detainees can now be held without charges for a ''reasonable'' period.   On Sept. 21, 2001, the Justice Department issued a memorandum reversing the detainee's right to open immigration hearings. In ''special-interest cases,'' according to the memorandum, hearings would be held behind closed doors. The immigration courts would not be required to confirm whether such cases were on the docket, and not even the relatives of detainees would be allowed to attend the secret hearings. ''Opening sensitive immigration hearings could compromise the security of our nation and our ongoing investigations,'' Barbara Comstock, a Justice Department spokeswoman, later elaborated in a statement. ''We are at war, facing a terrorist threat from unidentified foes who operate in covert ways and unknown places. This makes it essential that the United States take every legal step possible to protect the American people from acts of terrorism.''   Attorney General John Ashcroft himself recently defended the Bush administration's decision to beef up security measures at the expense of individuals' rights. ''History instructs us,'' he said, during a September 2002 address to United States attorneys in New York, ''that caution and complacency are not defenses of freedom: caution and complacency are a capitulation before freedom's enemies -- the terrorists.''    In several conversations and in the details of his suit, Omar has laid out his version of what happened next. While the case remains to be tried, this is the picture that emerges from his allegations.   Though Omar was told that he had passed his lie-detector test, he was hardly in the clear. Late in the afternoon of Sept. 13, 2001, he says, an armed I.N.S. agent in a cowboy hat served him with a document known as ''a notice to appear.'' Omar had no idea what that meant. It was not a criminal charge, he assumed, yet he was being taken for mug shots and fingerprinting.   You overstayed your tourist visa, the I.N.S. agent declared. ''But I'm legal,'' Omar stammered, perplexed, since his marriage to an American citizen made him eligible for permanent residency. ''I've got a work permit and everything.''   Sometime after midnight, he says, several I.N.S. agents slapped leg irons on him and cuffed him to a thick chain that was wrapped around his waist. Omar was put in the back of a tan Chevy sedan. ''Where are we going?'' he asked as they sped off. ''What's happening?'' No one said anything. They drove through the night, listening to country music.   ''I kept asking for an attorney,'' Omar recalls. ''Finally one of the agents in the car lost his temper and yelled: 'Listen, let me explain this to you. We're not going to baby-sit you like the F.B.I.'''   Omar still had no idea where they were taking him, though he could tell by the road signs that they had crossed over to Louisiana. The sun was already up when they pulled into a gas station, where an unmarked Ford Explorer and a police cruiser were waiting for them.   Their destination was an I.N.S. office in Oakdale, La. Omar, still in shackles, was taken into a room with a large glass partition. ''Everyone in the office was staring at me as if I was something nasty or dirty,'' he says. He had been handcuffed for 12 hours and was dizzy with hunger. ''I asked them to take off the cuffs. But the guard just said hell no.''   Several hours later, Omar was moved again, this time to the New Orleans Parish Prison. He says he was ordered to strip and spread his legs before being searched, issued a jumpsuit and allowed to call Candy.   She had been frantic and afraid to leave her apartment. The call from her husband, however, galvanized her into action. She arranged to drop Jasmine off with her mother, emptied their $700 bank account and drove south to Louisiana. The trip took more than 12 hours, and by the time she arrived at the New Orleans Parish Prison, Omar was already gone. He had been transferred in the middle of the night to a maximum-security prison, and when Candy called, no one would tell her if he was even there.   ''I begged the administrator,'' Candy recalls. ''I said, 'He is my husband -- I need to find him!' But the woman just said, 'I think national security is more important right now.'''    All across America, Muslim men were literally disappearing into the prison system. On Sept. 20, 2001, Shakir Baloch, a Canadian citizen of Pakistani origin, was arrested in New York by the I.N.S. and F.B.I., and despite official inquiries from Ottawa, his detention was not disclosed for more than three months. He was held for half a year before being sent back to Canada. In California, an Egyptian-born dentist was taken into custody at a Los Angeles-area gas station, and while his friends searched for him in local jails, he was flown to a detention center in Brooklyn. In New Jersey, Anser Mehmood's wife spent six weeks searching for her husband, who was arrested in late September, not formally charged with a visa violation until March 2002 and held in an isolation cell with 24-hour lighting for seven months. The wife of an Egyptian national arrested in early September did not see her husband until Dec. 19, 2001. She passed on a letter he wrote to Amnesty International. ''I have now been in solitary confinement for three and a half months. . . . Why am I imprisoned? What are they accusing me of?''    It was only when he got to the maximum-security federal penitentiary in Pollock, La., sometime after 2 the next morning, that Omar realized the severity of his situation, as he charges in his lawsuit against the government. No one even knew he was there, and he was not permitted to make any calls. Strip, he was told, once again. A dozen officials, including two women, he recalls, looked on. Someone produced a camcorder and began taping as Omar undressed. Omar stood naked while his body cavities were searched for the third time in less than four days.   He still has trouble speaking in front of his wife about what happened next. ''They told me to lift my testicles,'' Omar remembers, blushing slightly. ''One of the guards pointed at my backside and said, 'You sure you're not hiding anything in there?' I said no. 'I think he's got something in there,' he told the others.'' One of the corrections officers, he says, placed a call, and a man in white medical scrubs entered the room. He wore a latex glove. Bend over, he said. Squinting from the pain, Omar looked up at one of the I.N.S. guards who had escorted him from the New Orleans prison. She was laughing, he says. (A Bureau of Prisons spokeswoman in Washington, Traci Billingsley, said that intrusive searches are performed ''extremely rarely'' in the penal system.)   Isolation Cell No. 1 measured 10 feet by 10 feet. At its center was a concrete bunk. The only other furnishings were a plastic chair and a metal toilet. Now dressed in an orange jumpsuit, Omar desperately needed to use the bathroom but was still shackled. ''Can you take these off?'' he asked. The answer was no. ''But how am I going to --?'' The question was cut off by a corrections officer who motioned for another guard to join him. Each grabbed one of Omar's elbows and steered him to the bowl. But with the handcuffs still on, he could barely manage his zipper, much less aim. Urine began running down his pant leg as, he maintains, the guards laughed.   Warden Carl Casterline came to visit him the next morning. ''He said he had orders from Washington to keep me there until further notice,'' Omar says. Omar again asked to telephone an attorney but says his request was denied. The warden was polite but firm on the matter; he had instructions from D.C., he said. The warden asked if he any special dietary needs. ''I don't eat pork,'' Omar said. Lunch was brought to him soon after. It consisted, he says, of bologna and ham. The lawsuit contends that the warden deprived Omar of his right to a religious diet.   Casterline's office declined to comment on any aspect of this account, referring queries to the Bureau of Prisons in Washington. Billingsley, the B.O.P. spokeswoman, said she could not speak to Omar's case specifically but explained that federal policy allows inmates access to telephones for up to 300 minutes a month, provides alternative religious diets and mandates that prisoners be given exercise periods outside their cells.   Omar decided to go on a hunger strike until he was allowed to call counsel. The guards were unmoved. ''One of them said, 'The attorney general just signed a new law today,''' Omar remembers. ''We can keep you here as long as we like.'''   For the next 10 days, Omar was not allowed out of his cell. ''I thought I had died and this was hell.'' He kept having recurring dreams that his mother and little brother in Egypt were dead and that he was holding his daughter, Jasmine. He would wake crying and hide under his blanket so that the guards did not see.   The F.B.I. returned a few days later with a consent form they wanted him to sign allowing the search of a crate of sample antiques he had received from Cairo. He signed the papers, he says, and again asked for a lawyer.   By the time the attorney Candy had hired to find her husband, Lawrence Fabacher, finally reached his client, it was too late to prepare for Omar's immigration hearing, which had been scheduled for Oct. 2. The hearing was pushed back two weeks.   ''I tried to sleep as much as possible to make the time go faster,'' Omar recalls. He did push-ups and sit-ups to keep fit, but his cell was so cold that he got the chills whenever he broke a sweat. They had turned off the hot water to his shower, so he stopped bathing. Pork was served at least twice a day.   He had a newfound desire to practice his religion and tried to guess the correct hours for prayers by following the changing of the guards. They would congregate outside his cell and make faces whenever he tried to pray.   On Oct. 16, two days before his I.N.S. hearing, two F.B.I. agents appeared. Omar recognized one as the polygraph technician from Little Rock. They wanted to know about his financial affairs; around that time, the hunt for Al Qaeda had shifted to tracing the money trail. For more than four hours, they pored over his banking and credit-card statements. Omar was questioned about every deposit, withdrawal and major purchase he had made since coming to America and asked about the nature of the antiques business he wanted to start.   Again, he was shown photographs of the hijackers and of Osama bin Laden and asked if he recognized any of them. ''Sure,'' Omar said, pointing to bin Laden. The agents pounced: Where do you know him from? Television, Omar answered.   He submitted to another lie-detector test, similar to the one he'd taken in Fort Smith, except that it now included questions about whether he had ever lied on I.N.S. application forms and if he was currently married to Candy.   The results of the test apparently were not conclusive. The exam was re-administered, with the same result. We have to send for a specialist, the technician said.   The specialist arrived from Houston the following day, lugging a digital polygraph machine that was hooked up to a laptop computer. Omar, by this time, could recite the questions by rote. But the F.B.I. was still not satisfied. One answer in particular kept coming up as inconclusive. And it happened to be the most important one: shown a picture of the hijackers, he was asked if he knew any of them.   ''The specialist from Houston freaked out,'' Omar recalls. ''He leaned in so close that his nose was almost touching mine. You know somebody, he shouted. No, I yelled back. Yes, he screamed. I can see your mind on my computer screen.''   Eventually everyone simmered down. ''We can help you,'' Omar remembers the specialist saying, ''if you help us. We can get you a new identity. We can get you money. You know there's a $25 million reward for Osama's capture. We can move you anyplace and protect Jasmine and Candy.''   The next morning, Omar's immigration hearing went surprisingly well. The judge seemed sympathetic and ordered him released on the relatively low bond of $5,000. ''I was so excited,'' Omar recalls. He says he ate his first complete meal in days and cleaned his cell. He could barely sleep that night and woke early. Candy would be coming to collect him at the opening of business hours. He sat expectantly on his bunk, his few belongings in a neat pile. The hours passed: 9, noon, 3 in the afternoon, then 4 and, finally, 5. At 6, he called a prison administrator. The I.N.S. prosecutor had appealed his bond. Under the new antiterror measures, the government could overturn judges' decisions in ''special-interest cases.''   Even today, Omar gets emotional when describing how he felt when he heard the news. He stopped eating. For 68 hours, he didn't touch food or drink, until, he says, they threatened to put tubes up his nose. ''It was like part of me just died,'' he remembers.   Omar was in a near-catatonic state. He couldn't tell the difference between day and night, weekdays and weekends any longer. As the weeks passed, his depression grew deeper. He lost 20 pounds. A second closed immigration hearing in mid-November did not go well. The judge was apologetic but said there was nothing he could do; the government had made the call.   Omar now hardly moved from his concrete bunk. His feet grew swollen from inactivity. ''I thought I would have to stay in that room forever,'' he recalls. He couldn't take it any longer. He decided to kill himself -- and to make this intention known.   Suddenly, everyone seemed very concerned. The warden visited and sent a psychiatrist. The F.B.I. man came and kept asking if he was serious about suicide. They could probably tell he had reached the end of his rope. And maybe, in the end, that was what saved him.   t's impossible to say precisely why the authorities finally decided that Omar must be telling the truth. One senior law enforcement official in Washington did, however, agree to share a theory, on the condition that neither his name nor the agency he works for be revealed.   ''If your subject has a complete breakdown,'' he said, ''the barriers to resistance are lessened. Once a person is at that point, he has lost the will to deceive, and you can be pretty certain that he's not lying.''   Omar had apparently passed his final test. Is he innocent? It is, of course, impossible to know, just as it is impossible to frame the question. Innocent of what? Charges were never presented. Perhaps the most important indication of his innocence is that for 73 days the government could find nothing beyond its original suspicions to hold him on. On Nov. 20, he was told to get his things together. ''Do you want to go home?'' a cheerful I.N.S. official asked. Three days later he was with Candy, on the freeway driving to Arkansas to see Jasmine.   The ordeal, however, is not entirely over. The couple is broke; they have been forced to sell their car and furniture and move in with Candy's father, a postal worker. Many of their friends have deserted them. Employment prospects for Omar are bleak: he was fired by his pre-9/11 employer, and the only work he can find now is volunteering for a charity for disadvantaged children. And the government, citing Omar's first marriage, which it says was a sham (a charge Omar denies), has continued deportation proceedings against him. They just want him out of here, for reasons they still will not explain.     Matthew Brzezinski is a contributing writer for the magazine.

Last month, asked if there were new and conclusive evidence of Hussein's nuclear weapons capabilities, Bush cited a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency saying the Iraqis were 'six months away from developing a weapon.' And last week, the president said objections by a labor union to having customs officials wear radiation detectors has the potential to delay the policy 'for a long period of time.'  All three assertions were powerful arguments for the actions Bush sought. And all three statements were dubious, if not wrong. Further information revealed that the aircraft lack the range to reach the United States; there was no such report by the IAEA; and the customs dispute over the detectors was resolved long ago.  As Bush leads the nation toward a confrontation with Iraq and his party into battle in midterm elections, his rhetoric has taken some flights of fancy in recent weeks. Statements on subjects ranging from the economy to Iraq suggest that a president who won election underscoring Al Gore's knack for distortions and exaggerations has been guilty of a few himself.  Presidential embroidery is, of course, a hoary tradition. Ronald Reagan was known for his apocryphal story about liberating a concentration camp. Bill Clinton fibbed famously and under oath about his personal indiscretions to keep a step ahead of Whitewater prosecutors. Richard M. Nixon had his Watergate denials, and Lyndon B. Johnson was often accused of stretching the truth to put the best face on the Vietnam War. Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy, too, played with the truth during the Gary Powers and Bay of Pigs episodes.  'Everybody makes mistakes when they open their mouths and we forgive them,' Brookings Institution scholar Stephen Hess said. Some of Bush's overstatements appear to be off-the-cuff mistakes. But, Hess said, 'what worries me about some of these is they appear to be with foresight. This is about public policy in its grandest sense, about potential wars and who is our enemy, and a president has a special obligation to getting it right.'  The White House, while acknowledging that on one occasion the president was 'imprecise,' said it stands by his words. 'The president's statements are well documented and supported by the facts,' Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer said. 'We reject any allegation to the contrary.'  In stop after stop across the country, Bush has cited an impressive statistic in his bid to get Congress to approve terrorism insurance legislation. 'There's over $15 billion of construction projects which are on hold, which aren't going forward -- which means there's over 300,000 jobs that would be in place, or soon to be in place, that aren't in place,' is how he put it last week in Michigan.  But these are not government estimates. The $15 billion figure comes from the Real Estate Roundtable, a trade group that is leading the fight for the legislation and whose members have much to gain. After pleas earlier this year from the White House for 'hard evidence' to make its case for terrorism insurance, the roundtable got the information from an unscientific survey of members, who were asked to provide figures with no documentation.   The 300,000 jobs number, the White House said, was supplied by the carpenters' union. But a union official said the White House apparently 'extrapolated' the number from a Transportation Department study of federal highway aid -- not private real estate -- that the union had previously cited.  The president has also taken some liberties as he argues for his version of homeland security legislation. He often suggests in stump speeches that the union covering customs workers is blocking the wearing of radiation detectors. 'The leadership of that particular group of people said, 'No way; we need to have a collective bargaining session over whether or not our people should be made to wear these devices,' ' he said in Michigan last week. 'And that could take a long period of time.'  The National Treasury Employees Union did indeed argue in January that the radiation devices should be voluntary, and it called for negotiations. But five days later, the Customs Service said it saw no need to negotiate and would begin to implement the policy, which it did. After a subsequent exchange between the union president and Customs Service commissioner, the union wrote in April that it 'does not object' to mandatory wearing of the devices.  The Customs Service said the delay had less to do with the dispute than the fact that customs lacks enough devices (about 4,000 are on order). The White House and Customs Service said the dispute was settled in part because Bush had the authority to waive collective bargaining, although he did not exercise it.  On Sept. 7, meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair at Camp David, Bush told reporters: 'I would remind you that when the inspectors first went into Iraq and were denied, finally denied access, a report came out of the Atomic -- the IAEA -- that they were six months away from developing a weapon. I don't know what more evidence we need.'  The IAEA did issue a report in 1998, around the time weapons inspectors were denied access to Iraq for the final time, but the report made no such assertion. It declared: 'Based on all credible information to date, the IAEA has found no indication of Iraq having achieved its program goal of producing nuclear weapons or of Iraq having retained a physical capability for the production of weapon-useable nuclear material or having clandestinely obtained such material.' The report said Iraq had been six to 24 months away from nuclear capability before the 1991 Gulf War.   The White House said that Bush 'was imprecise on this' and that the source was U.S. intelligence, not the IAEA.  In the president's Oct. 7 speech to the nation from Cincinnati, he introduced several rationales for taking action against Iraq. Describing contacts between al Qaeda and Iraq, Bush cited 'one very senior al Qaeda leader who received medical treatment in Baghdad this year.' He asserted that 'we have discovered through intelligence that Iraq has a growing fleet' of unmanned aircraft and expressed worry about them 'targeting the United States.'  Bush also stated that in 1998, 'information from a high-ranking Iraqi nuclear engineer who had defected revealed that despite his public promises, Saddam Hussein had ordered his nuclear program to continue.' He added, 'Iraq could decide on any given day to provide a biological or chemical weapon to a terrorist group or individual terrorists,' an alliance that 'could allow the Iraqi regime to attack America without leaving any fingerprints.'   In each of these charges, Bush omitted qualifiers that make the accusations seem less convincing. In the case of the al Qaeda leader receiving medical treatment, U.S. intelligence officials acknowledged that the terrorist, Abu Musab Zarqawi, was no longer in Iraq and that there was no hard evidence Hussein's government knew he was there or had contact with him. On the matter of the aircraft, a CIA report this month suggested that the fleet was more of an 'experiment' and 'attempt' and labeled it a 'serious threat to Iraq's neighbors and to international military forces in the region' -- but said nothing about it having sufficient range to threaten the United States.  Bush's statement about the Iraqi nuclear defector, implying such information was current in 1998, was a reference to Khidhir Hamza. But Hamza, though he spoke publicly about his information in 1998, retired from Iraq's nuclear program in 1991, fled to the Iraqi north in 1994 and left the country in 1995. Finally, Bush's statement that Iraq could attack 'on any given day' with terrorist groups was at odds with congressional testimony by the CIA. The testimony, declassified after Bush's speech, rated the possibility as 'low' that Hussein would initiate a chemical or biological weapons attack against the United States but might take the 'extreme step' of assisting terrorists if provoked by a U.S. attack.  White House spokesmen said in response that it was 'unrealistic' to assume Iraqi authorities did not know of Zarqawi's presence and that Iraq's unmanned aircraft could be launched from ships or trucks outside Iraq.   Some of the disputed Bush assertions are matters of perspective.  Bush often says, as he did Friday in Missouri, that 'because of a quirk in the rules in the United States Senate, after a 10-year period, the tax-relief plan we passed goes away.' There is a Senate rule that required a 60-vote majority for the tax cut, but the decision to let the cuts expire was based on pragmatic considerations. Proponents of the cut from the House and Senate -- both under GOP control at the time -- decided to have the tax cut expire after nine years to keep its price tag within the $1.35 trillion over 10 years that had been agreed between lawmakers and Bush.  Other times, the president's assertions simply outpace the facts. In New Hampshire earlier this month, he said his education legislation made 'the biggest increase in education spending in a long, long time.'   In fact, the 15.8 percent increase in Department of Education discretionary spending for fiscal year 2002 (the figures the White House supplied when asked about Bush's statement) was below the 18.5 percent increase under Clinton the previous year -- and Bush had wanted a much smaller increase than Congress approved. Earlier this month, Republican moderates complained to Bush's budget director, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., that the administration was not spending the full amount for education that Congress approved. Daniels said it was 'nothing uncommon' and decried the 'explosively larger education bill.'    2002 The Washington Post Company           "

"7043",7043,734562,"Libra","           I would counter that there is now a precedent for federal court intervention in federal elections and that there is a constitutional basis for it. the supreme court did not choose bush over gore as much as it made florida clearly define what their election process is and whether the process itself violated federal law. from bush vs. gore  urlLink http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=531&invol=98   The petition presents the following questions: whether the Florida Supreme Court established new standards for resolving Presidential election contests, thereby violating Art. II, 1, cl. 2, of the United States Constitution and failing to comply with 3 U. S. C. 5, and whether the use of standardless manual recounts violates the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses. With respect to the equal protection question, we find a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  The Florida Supreme Court has ordered that the intent of the voter be discerned from such ballots. For purposes of resolving the equal protection challenge, it is not necessary to decide whether the Florida Supreme Court had the authority under the legislative scheme for resolving election disputes to define what a legal vote is and to mandate a manual recount implementing that definition. The recount mechanisms implemented in response to the decisions of the Florida Supreme Court do not satisfy the minimum requirement for non-arbitrary treatment of voters necessary to secure the fundamental right. Florida's basic command forthe count of legally cast votes is to consider the 'intent of the voter.' Gore v. Harris, ___ So. 2d, at ___ (slip op., at 39). This is unobjectionable as an abstract proposition and a starting principle. The problem inheres in the absence of specific standards to ensure its equal application. The formulation of uniform rules to determine intent based on these recurring circumstances is practicable and, we conclude, necessary.  While I understand Ted Rall's frustration with having Bush as president, I do not agree that the election was a judicial coup d'etat.  What it was though is an example, notedin the supreme court ruling itself, that the vote counting systems in this country are antiquated and need to be changed and standardized so everyone's vote can be counted. Florida was having different counties determine what was and was not a 'hanging chad'.  how can this be considered equal protection for all state voters wheneach district has it's own standards about what constitutes a vote?  and jimi, this case in front of the supreme court was brought by bush not by gore.           "
"7044",7044,734562,"Libra","           Let's get the record straight about the 2000 Election.  After each recount Bush still won in Florida.  I believe there were 3 recounts: a machine recount, and 2 hand recounts.  At the conclusion of each one, the Gore team (not Bush) cried foul and appealed to the higher courts.  It was the Gore team that tried and succeded in a lot of cases to have military absentee votes invalidated because of technicalities.  And they cheered when the decision by the court was returned in their favor!  Can you believe that?!  A candidate who consistently said he wanted 'to be sure that each vote was counted' had his attourneys in court cheering when they discredited the validity of the votes of men and women serving their country!  What a 'man' Gore is!     Next, there  is  federal election law provided in the Constitution.  The Constitution provides the boundaries for electing the President by the electors of the Electoral College.  Check out this web site for more info:   http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/refarticle.aspx?refid=761576768               'The electoral system was devised by the drafters of the Constitution of the United States, who hoped thereby to entrust the responsibility to people whose choice would be unaffected by partisan politics. In Article II, Section 1, of the Constitution, the method of selecting electors is delegated to the separate state legislatures, and the voting procedure to be followed by the electors is carefully defined. According to the electoral procedure originally specified in the Constitution, the electors were to vote for the two most qualified persons without specifying which was preferred for president and which for vice president. The candidate receiving the greatest number of electoral votes, provided the votes of a majority of the electors were received, would be president, and the candidate winning the second largest number of votes would be vice president. A serious flaw in this procedure was revealed in the election of 1800, when Thomas Jefferson was the presidential candidate of the Democratic-Republican Party (the forerunner of todays Democratic Party) and Aaron Burr was the candidate for vice president. The electors, by voting strictly for candidates of their party, gave Burr and Jefferson the same number of votes. As the Constitution provided, the election was referred to the House of Representatives, where a protracted struggle took place, requiring 36 ballots before Jefferson was chosen president and Burr vice president. Therefore, in 1804 Congress enacted and the states ratified the 12th Amendment, providing for separate electoral votes for president and for vice president.'   As you see in the article, the selecting of electors is left to the states' legislatures, but the election of a President is outlined in the Constitution.  Ben, the author of your article didn't do his homework.  The election of Bush to office according to the Constitution is fully legit.  Sorry, Democrats!   As far as the Toricelli case, Representatives and Senators are elected according to individual laws of the states.  So I can understand why the Supreme Court refused to hear the case.         "
"7045",7045,734562,"Libra","           A stay would be 'the only means of protecting the integrity of the federal election process,' Republicans argued. But that's exactly the point: there is no 'federal election process.' Elections, even for national office, are governed by state law and administered by state bureaucrats. The highest arbiter of election disputes is each state's supreme court.  The 2000 Florida dispute resulted in Republicans--historically the great champions of states' rights--obtaining the help of the federal court system to subvert the states' constitutionally-protected control of elections. An appeal of the Florida Supreme Court's decision, no matter how flawed that decision may have been, violated the Constitution. The fact that Renhquist et al. agreed to hear Bush v. Gore is what makes Bush's regime illegal. Had the court installed Gore rather than Bush, Gore would be the usurper. Recounts, hanging chads, choosing Bush over Gore--those details are mere footnotes to a brazenly extrajurisdictional judicial coup d'tat.  A Republican-controlled U.S. Supreme Court broke the law on behalf of George W. Bush. Would they do it for Douglas Forrester? 'The elites beat up on the Supreme Court very severely for Bush v. Gore,' commented conservative George Mason University professor Dan Polsby. 'I'm sure they don't relish being beat up by those elites again.' On Oct. 7 the Supremes did what they ought to have done two years ago in the Florida case--they refused to hear the case, without comment.  Election disputes, after all, are resolved by each state's supreme court.    urlLink - Ted Rall,  The Ironic Implication of the New Jersey Imbroglio           "

"7080",7080,734562,"Libra","           the new 'state-of-the-arf' shelter - this makes me proud to be a richmonder  The Cat's Pajamas  Richmond SPCA Opens Its Deluxe Animal Shelter   By Don Oldenburg Washington Post Staff Writer Tuesday, November 26, 2002; Page C01    RICHMOND  When you walk into the Richmond SPCA's Robins-Starr Humane Center -- an animal shelter -- instead of hearing pained howls and barks, you get soothing strains of Mozart or New Age music. Instead of the stench of hapless animals, the air smells outdoor fresh. Instead of depressed dogs and cats killing time in cramped cages, these potential pets are bright-eyed and ready to go in their 'living rooms.'  With its stylish interior painted bold yellows, blue-violets and mauves, the new 'state-of-the-arf' shelter, which opened last month, looks more like a fancy hotel. Natural light pours down from huge skylights. Bronze sculptures and paintings lend the feel of an art gallery. And the canine living rooms and cat cotillions are unmistakenly homelike.  'Oh, my gosh!' says first-time visitor Katherine Gregory, from South Riding in Loudoun County. In Richmond visiting her mother, Gregory stopped by the center with her sons, Andrew, 10, and Matthew, 7, in search of a kitten. 'I'm amazed. I recently went to the Loudoun shelter and the Fairfax shelter, and they aren't anything like this!'  Pound for pound, this 64,000-square-foot center -- currently housing about two-thirds of its capacity, which is 150 dogs and 150 cats -- is not like any animal shelter you've ever seen. The facility, located in a warehouse district off the Boulevard exit from Interstate 95, is among the largest nationwide. But size isn't everything: The center was designed to defy preconceptions, the theory being that a cheery environment will foster a higher rate of adoption.  That's critical, since the motive for this $7.2 million shelter was the Richmond SPCA's decision to 'go no-kill.' The group is also committed to making the whole city no-kill by 2008.  'What keeps people from walking in the door of a shelter? It's noisy, it's depressing, it's scary, it's smelly,' says Denise Deisler, the Richmond SPCA's associate executive director. 'This place is bright and friendly.'  The building is a 78-year-old red-brick tobacco warehouse with a verdigris seamed roof. Beyond the lobby are 11 glass-doored 'dog living rooms.' About the size of a small bedroom, each is furnished with a stylish blue metal bench and chairs and a puffy dog bed. A large Labrador-mix named Old Bay sits eagerly at the door of one. On his windowsill is this personal publicity: a can of Old Bay Seasoning and a note, 'I like lots of love and need to take long walks on the beach.'   'They will allow you to go in these rooms and actually sit with the dog, and play with the dog, get to know the dog, walk the dog outside,' says Tony Zimmer, the contractor who oversaw the renovation but kept returning after it was done.  A 'lifelong dog person,' Zimmer says he kept coming back because the people, the place and the pets left him feeling good. 'It's not like looking at dogs in cages. You actually get to know the dog.' A couple weeks ago, he took home a 4-month-old red chow.  The public can also visit dogs in the less flashy kennel rooms. The 22 'kennel runs,' each four feet wide and 14 feet long, are significantly larger than standard shelter cages.  At the opposite end of the shelter are the individual cat 'condos' and three cat 'cotillions' -- large rooms with open drawers, cubbyholes and climbing poles, where as many as 10 cats live and people can visit.  All details are designed to bring out the best in the animals. The floors are soft, waterproof epoxy-finished surfaces and the ceilings are sound-absorbent. The cacophony typical of kennels not only is unpleasant for people but also hurts the animals (dogs can hear frequencies more than 20 kHz higher than humans; cats, more than 45 kHz higher).  'When a dog is in pain from the sound, that elevates the stress level,' says Emerson Hughes, owner of Holiday Barn Pet Resorts and former chairman of the Richmond SPCA board, who oversaw the project.  Although the creature comforts are as much for visitors, Deisler says Mozart really does soothe the savage beast -- or confused puppy. In a study conducted at Queen's University in Belfast, psychologists found that heavy-metal music increased anxiety in dogs and caused barking, while classical music alleviated stress and quieted barking.  The shelter's classical music is digitally altered to put a damper on the ultrahigh and low frequencies. 'If they are too stressed out, that reduces their immune system and that leads to them being sick, and if they are sick we can't adopt them,' says Deisler.  But what an adoring public sees and hears in the adoption area is just a small part of the center. Only about a quarter of the animals are available for adoption at any one time. The rest are being rehabbed.  Behind the scenes, every animal gets a physical and behavioral checkup. Dogs with contagious diseases -- like Raspie, a 4-year-old Sheltie with kennel cough -- are confined to the Physical Rehab Room for treatment. Staff experts work with personality problems in the Behavioral Rehab Room. Even healthy animals get a three-day adjustment period to acclimate to shelter life.  Zephia Scarborough adopted a black-and-white kitten she named Steinway a few weeks ago. Because he had been trapped inside a wall for several days before being rescued, the kitten was traumatized. Before taking Steinway home, she had to wait for him to come out of rehab. 'Ten days later, he was fat and happy and purring,' the Richmond resident says.  Also hidden are the shelter's command centers for its centrally controlled, high-pressure hydro-cleaning system that borrows from car wash technology, and its advanced air-exchange system that sends fresh air throughout the building every six minutes. 'It's good for reducing the spread of disease and the odors in the building, and it has the side benefit of not collecting as much dust and hairballs,' says Deisler.  Near the entrance is the spay-neuter clinic. Each year, 18,000 'companion animals' end up here or in one of the city or county shelters in the greater Richmond area; in the past, half of those animals were euthanized. Now the center spays or neuters every animal when it arrives and offers those services at low cost to the public.  Pet overpopulation is a nationwide problem, of course. Accurate numbers aren't available, but the Humane Society of the United States estimates that 8 million to 10 million dogs and cats enter U.S. shelters each year and that half are euthanized. Locally, the Montgomery County Humane Society shelter, the only one in the county, took in 6,650 dogs and cats in the year that ended in July and euthanized about 2,600. The D.C. Animal Shelter took in 9,284 and euthanized 65 percent of them.  Deisler mentions a statistic. How many dogs and cats would every person in the United States have to own to empty all of the shelters? 'It just blew my mind,' she says. 'Six cats and two dogs.'  On the second floor is a 'humane library,' a large auditorium that seats 300 people for educational programs and benefit events, and a spectacular rubber-padded jogging track and training arena where all dogs are exercised and obedience classes are held.  'Part of making this community no-kill is you've got to provide good educational programs for people to understand how to do it,' says Robin Robertson Starr, executive director of the facility, who expects the center to help 6,000 to 8,000 animals get adopted annually -- twice as many as the old shelter.  At the forefront of a revolution in the pet care industry, the Richmond center is attracting international attention. Since opening, it has received 250 job and volunteer applications. (Besides 150 volunteers, it employs 50 kennel workers and staffers whose annual salaries range from $20,000 to $36,000.) People from other SPCAs nationwide call for tours. Starr has participated in an 'international chat' online and a conference in Atlanta. The Mayor's Alliance for Animals in New York has contacted the Richmond SPCA about how it is working with the city to solve the animal overpopulation problem.  The center's no-kill policy means it does not kill animals due to overpopulation. It takes in only animals that it can physically and behaviorally rehabilitate to an adoptable condition. All animals at the shelter stay there until they are adopted. 'We control admissions so as never to exceed our capacity,' says Starr.  Even private kennels are upgrading facilities in what the American Pet Products and Manufacturing Association calls a $31 billion industry: This month, Olde Towne Pet Resort opened in Springfield. Billing itself as 'The Ultimate Pet Care Facility,' it offers services such as an indoor hydrotherapy pool and an indoor walking track and agility course.  'It's more than just the building, it's the no-kill policy. No-kill is the real trend toward significant change,' says Starr, after whom the center was named, along with patron E. Claiborne Robins Jr. In the first 10 months of this year, 1,200 fewer animals were euthanized by the Richmond SPCA than in the same period the year before.  Some of the interest is in how the Richmond SPCA raised $14.2 million in three years during an economic downturn. Half of that went to build and half to operate; the operating budget, derived from donations, is $2.5 million a year, twice that of the old shelter.  'You work really hard,' says Starr, an attorney who worked full time those three years raising donations -- nearly all of them coming from the Richmond community.  Outside her second-floor office, playing with her own 3-year-old shaggy mutt named Nibblet, one of the four dogs and two cats she has adopted, Starr says people 'care a lot about the humane cause, but people don't care a lot about continuing to throw their money at something that never changes.'  What worked in Richmond, she explains, 'was presenting them with a problem that can be licked, telling them how it can be licked.'  But whenever an animal shelter upgrades beyond concrete floors and clanky cages, Starr says, someone always questions treating animals so well when homeless people are sleeping on the streets.  'I have trouble with that comparison,' she says. 'If we wanted to say that human homelessness is the cause that matters the most, then that could also be said of the money that goes to art museums, or the money that goes to botanical gardens, or the performing arts.  'All of those are valuable things that improve the quality of our lives. So do pets. They enormously improve the quality of our lives.'           "

We went in for a routine check, and the doctor saw something she did not like and sent Julie down for observation.  Come to find out, she was having contractions and did not even notice them.  She is only 26 weeks, so no one wants to see these babies born yet.  They gave Julie some medicine that did not stop the contractions.  They then tried a different, stronger, medicine, and it did not work either.  By 5 o'clock, her very reserved doctor, was visibly concerned about the situation.  Finally, around 7, the contractions slowed. and have, as of an hour ago, stopped.  Julie will be in the hospital through at least tomorrow, depending on how she reacts to being weened off the medication.  After that though, she will be on mandatory bedrest.

In one last-minute addition, Representative Dick Armey, Republican of Texas, inserted a provision that was apparently intended to protect Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical giant, from lawsuits over thimerosal, a mercury-based vaccine preservative that some parents contend has caused autism in their children.  full article from the ny times :   House Approves Domestic Security Bill By DAVID FIRESTONE  ASHINGTON, Nov. 13  The House hurriedly approved a revised domestic security bill tonight to reflect a new agreement with the White House on reducing worker protections, brushing aside Democratic objections that Republican leaders had added several provisions benefiting businesses and Republican interests.  The bill, approved 299 to 121, would reverse an earlier measure and allow American companies that have moved offshore in order to evade taxes to contract with the Homeland Security Department. It would also extend protection against liability suits for airline screening companies and many other businesses that contract with the department, and adds a similar provision protecting the makers of smallpox vaccines.  Most Democrats voted against the bill, with many raising objections to the new provisions and the altering of Civil Service rules.  The House voted 215 to 203 along party lines not to create an independent commission to investigate the Sept. 11 attacks. Several members of both parties in the two chambers said they would try to include the commission in an intelligence spending bill that has still not been passed. But Republican House leaders said the commission needed more planning, drawing complaints from relatives of attack victims that they were trying to hide failures that might have prevented the attacks.  Working to conclude the year's legislative business by week's end, the House also passed a stopgap spending measure to keep the government operating through January. Many members of both parties had hoped the House would pass at least a few of the pending appropriations bills the government uses to keep operating, but House leaders said they would take up the bills once the new Congress convened next year.  As expected, Republican House members elected Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, formerly the majority whip, to the new post of majority leader in the next session.   Democratic House members are scheduled to conduct their leadership elections on Thursday, and are likely to choose Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, now the minority whip, as their leader.  This morning, however, a new candidate for the job emerged, demonstrating the continuing disagreements among Democrats over how to respond to their losses in last week's elections. Representative Marcy Kaptur of Ohio said she would run for the position to draw votes from members who object to Ms. Pelosi's emphasis on fund-raising.  'We will never raise more money than the Republicans  never,' said Ms. Kaptur, who is known for her opposition to free-trade measures and federal funding for abortions. 'We must elevate the non-money wing of the Democratic Party and create populist symbols to convey our message.'  Ms. Kaptur joins Harold E. Ford Jr. of Tennessee in contesting the Democratic leadership election, for which Ms. Pelosi claims to already have sufficient support to win.  In the Senate, Republicans chose Trent Lott of Mississippi to be the majority leader in the next term, along with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky as majority whip and Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona in the third-ranking job of leading the Republican Policy Committee. Mr. Lott said after today's election that Republicans would focus on national and economic security, mentioning specifically a prescription drug program for low-income older people and making individual retirement accounts easier to use.  Senate Democrats also held their leadership elections today, unanimously choosing Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota as chairman of the caucus, along with Senators Harry Reid of Nevada and Barbara A. Mikulski of Maryland in the No. 2 and No. 3 positions. Mr. Daschle will be minority leader in the next Senate, Mr. Reid will be minority whip.  Senators also voted 58 to 36 not to block their annual pay raise, which would increase their salaries by 3.1 percent to $154,700 to $150,000 next year. Passage of an energy bill was deferred until next year because of continuing partisan disagreements over regulation and conservation.  The Senate began a lengthier process of approving the domestic security bill, which is expected to pass as early as Friday.  Senators showed that they remained closely divided on the bill, deciding 50 to 47 to drop the Democratic version of the bill on a closely watched test vote. The new version of the bill will have enough votes for passage, but many Democrats remain upset that President Bush won virtually his entire plan to cut back on civil service protections for workers, making it easier to fire and transfer them.  Many Democrats in both chambers were furious today when they read the fine print of the new version of the bill and found that Republicans had inserted provisions that had not been discussed in the six months of debate on the antiterrorism department, or that had been cut in the Senate bill.  The new language, for example, allows the administration to reorganize the department after it is created, differing from the Senate Republican version that would require congressional approval of a reorganization. It revises a provision, passed 318 to 110 in July, that prohibited contracts with offshore tax-evading companies, allowing the department to waive the ban in the name of saving American jobs.  The bill would allow immunity from liability for companies that make faulty antiterrorism devices or technology, and would make it difficult to sue companies that make smallpox vaccinations if the vaccines cause illness.  In one last-minute addition, Representative Dick Armey, Republican of Texas, inserted a provision that was apparently intended to protect Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical giant, from lawsuits over thimerosal, a mercury-based vaccine preservative that some parents contend has caused autism in their children.  'I'm really quite surprised they would put in the fine-print provisions we never saw in any other versions, that never even went through committees,' said Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee.'  But Republicans, like Representative William M. Thornberry of Texas, said the additions were minor and paled next to the importance of creating a department to protect the nation's safety.               "

"7150",7150,734562,"Libra","             Tori Amos Scarlet's Walk  (Epic)  Tori Amos is one of America's most polarizing artists, with each album predictably regarded as a love-it-or-hate-it proposition sure to thrill every fan and aggravate every hater. But she's made good and bad records just like anyone else: For proof, listen to her sublime From The Choirgirl Hotel and her horrid covers album Strange Little Girls back to back. Amos' well-documented idiosyncrasies tend to be reflected in teeth-gnashingly twee flights of fancy just as often as they produce bracing catharsis, making her catalog both rewarding and punishing when taken as a whole. Come to think of it, that just about sums up Scarlet's Walk, her epic follow-up to Strange Little Girls. A characteristically oblique concept album about finding the soul of America in its open roads, the disc marks a vast leap beyond its more gimmicky predecessor. From the pretty ballad 'Your Cloud' to the irresistibly poppy single 'A Sorta Fairytale,' Scarlet's Walk moves through some remarkable terrain. But amid all the elegantly sweeping, minor-key arrangements are the usual aggravating moments, most notably at the end of songs like 'Mrs. Jesus' (yeech) and 'Wednesday,' which each close with a breathless solo a cappella vocal for dramatic effect. The result tends to highlight lines that don't serve her well: Try not to groan when Amos stops the music on 'Wednesday' long enough to wheeze, 'Lost in a place called America.' But on Scarlet's Walk, her audacity is just as often admirable, and the album represents a considerable step up for fans and foes alike. Stephen Thompson  not from that album but one of my favorite tori songs She's Your Cocaine She's got you shaving your legs you can suck anything but you know you wanna be me put on your makeup boy you're your favourite stranger and we all like to watch So shimmy once and do it again bring your sister if you can't handle it she says you control it then she says you don't control it then she says you're controlling the way she makes you crawl She's your Cocaine your Exodus laughing and she knows what you are so shimmy once and do it again Bring your sister Bring your sister if you can't handle it If you want me to Boy I could lie to you you don't need one of these to let me inside of you and is it true that devils end up like you do something safe for the picture frame and is it true that devils end up like you so tied up you don't know how she came She's your Cocaine She's got you shaving your legs she got you liking mine back got me takin it in getting mine back lasting mine evil I'm taking my easel and I'm writing good checks you sign Prince of Darkness try squire of dimness please don't help me with this               "

"7158",7158,734562,"Libra","           A quick note, kids: Life has a funny way of working out (to paraphrase Alanis), and the irony of it all is a balm to sooth even the deepest hurts. For those of you who don't know, I spent seven long, dark, dismal months looking for a job. For those of you unfortunate enough to have lived through an extended period of unplanned joblessness, you know the drill. Darkness. Dispair. etc., ad nasuem, without end. I finally landed one in October, and was happy to begin the long process of rebuilding my work self-esteem. It's a job, even if it is a contract job. Even if the contract ends 31 December. It's a job. With a paycheck. I am happy.  So it was with the most wonderful sense of irony and wonderment at how Life can sometimes work out that I found myself yesterday driving a candy apple red Camero convertable down the Nimitz Highway toward my hotel on Waikiki Beach on a sunny Saturday afternoon. Honolulu for New Year's Eve. Yes, kids, through no effort of my own, I made a withdrawal from my burgeoning account at the Karma Bank.  And the icing: the per diem rate here is $78 a day.  If someone has a place to post them, I'll send pictures of Pearl Harbor when I go.  Happy New Year to all.   P.S.

Fabulous visuals.  A shame the story is veering from Tolkien now not only in terms of tone, but now of plot.  Note that the former issue (different tone) was my only complaint re: FotR.  Though I suspected slippage might kick in somewhere in the second movie.  I still maintain that Tolkien wrote a mythology, a history, and a travelogue, with heroic elements -- *not* an adventure story.  Which is what Jackson appears to have decided to film.  Which begs the question:  is this a book, or a film?  Clearly a film -- and as such, while it is a similar animal, it is truly another species than a book, with its own rules and expectations.  To put people in the seats, you don't film a book -- you pull the film out of the book, even if you have to alter it  to do so.  One can film a book, and do it beautifully -- but you better resign yourself to the art circuit.  We'll be glad to see you, but we ain't gonna give you box office.         "

"7175",7175,734562,"Libra","           For those that have not seen Two Towers yet, read carefully.  Nothing I consider a spoiler, but you may disagree.  As a Tolkien purist, I have several complaints.  As a movie fan, not so many, but, lord help you if you have not read the books or sat next to someone who could explain the finer points that are glossed over.  My biggest complaint is the fact that because they expanded on the Battle of Helm's Deep greatly (1/3 of the movie revolves around it - where it was one chapter out of about 12 in the first half of the book) and that they added the romance between Aragorn and Arwen plus a skirmish between the Rohan and Warg riding Goblins, they really only got through about 2/3 of the book.  Given the amount of fighting left to be shown in Return of the King, you can see that they will cut out several parts of the story.  Because of some of the modifications already seen, it does not appear that Aragorn will take the Path of Dead and bring the naval fleet up to break the siege.  They will also probably not address what becomes of Saruman and what happens to the Shire.  The greatly enhanced roles of Merry and Pippin (with Rohan and Gondor) do not appear to be occuring either.  Who will kill the Witch King?  I also think the tried to hard to set up the sequel.  The emphasis on Gollum's discussion of 'she' in regards to getting the Ring are totally transparent to those who have read the books, but not really sold well if you have not.All said and done, I enjoyed the movie, and intend to see it again (hopefully with Mr. Haley when he is back among the living), but am disappointed with the lack of trueness compared to FotR.  BTW, New Zealand is indeed a beautiful country.  I never would have thought they had the terrain and vistas they do.         "

"7178",7178,734562,"Libra","           Having grown up in Mississippi, I can say with some certainty that I agree with my future husband about his assessment of Lott.  He is intelligent and charismatic -- and ignorant as Mississippi Mud.  And I believe he, like many whites (and blacks, for that matter) from the Deep South, have latent issues with racism.  But I also agree that it's a social, not political issue.  Mississippi & Alabama really are almost different worlds from what goes on closer to the Mason-Dixon.  I had never seen such unconscious segregation until I moved there.  I am very happy to be further north now.  Remember also, Chris...that while Lott was attempting (poor thing) to cover his ass on BET (once again, having grown up in MS...BAAAAAHAAAAA!  you have no idea how funny THAT was for me)....he was asked why he voted against making MLK day a national holiday...and he responded by saying (this was voted on in 1983 or so, mind you) something to the effect of having not realized MLK's social-political-historical significance at the time.  What a jackass.  As for his future in the Senate, I don't really shive a git.  I don't live in MS anymore and am no longer directly affected by his decisions.  If government is what it was built to be, i. e. an accurate representation of its constituents, then Lott is a perfect representative for Mississippi and its beliefs.  So there ya go. I'm done.          "

"
"7180",7180,734562,"Libra","           It seems to me that neither Republicans nor Democrats ever really discuss what I would call politics.  For the record, I do not define the Lott issue as politics.  It's more like idle parlor talk.  Ideological masturbation.  I see no social or economic problem to solve by applying governmental political theory.  To me, it means nothing politically.  Emotionally, sure -- I can see it on that level.  Sociologically, certainly -- race is a fine subject for sociological study.  But politics?  I just don't see any point worth making on either ideological side.  Note that this is only only my opinion.  However, in the interests of idle parlor talk, I will toss this in the ring:  I perceive two kinds of racism.  First, conscious racism.  This is proactive, goal-oriented.  Extreme examples include hunting someone down and killing them, or burning crosses in yards.  It's fairly easy to spot, if only for its focused malignancy.  The second kind is similar in theme, yet very different.  I'll call it, for lack of a better term, unconscious racism.  Here, the person does not seek the destruction or expulsion of the group; he or she just sort of doesn't think about them much.  In fact, there isn't much thought at all.  This describes most of my immediate ancestors.  My grandmother, for example, would talk of 'colored' people in a way that meant no harm, but something in the tone suggested she unconsciously judged them by race.  There was no desire to actively seek out the race and destroy it; she was just -- well -- for lack of a better word -- naive and ignorant.  This does not make it right, but it is an important distinction.  Because in terms of Trent Lott, I have never perceived him as consciously, actively racist.  However, I have followed various biographies of him over the years, and heard him talk, and I have always felt comfortable that he fits well in the second category.  Not that he uses the word 'colored,' perhaps -- but there is a certain...well, naivete and ignorance in his words.  Case in point:  the birthday speech.  It seems to me that the words he chose revealed that mindless (rather than mindful) naivete and ignorance often exhibited by those who really haven't given the matter all that much thought.  This is not to say he is unintelligent, or evil, or good -- it's just an observation of his person.  Note that this is not observation of his *character*, which, for me, would not come into play unless he was in the first category, that of the conscious, ill-willed racist.  It seems to me that this is a man who isn't entirely on the ball about the whole race issue, and revealed his ambiguity (ambivalence?) through a naive and ignorant choice of words at the wrong time.  I do not condone what he said, nor do I praise it.  Ultimately it had absolutely no immediate impact on me.  I just watched the clip and thought 'Huh.  What an unfortunate place to utter such poorly thought-out words.'  All that said, to return to my original point -- it seems to me that so much more could be accomplished in this country if both Republicans and Democrats spent less time yammering on with all this ideological parlor talk and intellectual posturing, and focused all that mental energy on applying the broad range of available political philosophies to the immediate, tangible social, economic, and international issues that we as a society, a government, and a country would do well to confront.  There are real problems all around us.  Let's butt heads in a dialogue that matters, and work towards solutions that piss off all ideological sides just enough to the point that we're as close to the Truth as we can get.  I mean, come on, citizens.  Surely we're smarter than this.         "
"7181",7181,734562,"Libra","           Oh, Mir -- it's nice to see that things haven't changed!  As offended as you might be because Lott stepped up at the birthday party of a man who has lived ONE HUNDRED YEARS and said something vaguely nice about his past, I am 300% MORE offended that you have just compared Trent Lott to Adolf Hitler. There're extreme examples and then there are examples that are so extreme as to make them irrelevant. Exhibit A, your response below.  Once my breathing exercises kicked in, I was able to conjure up a response. Here's a counter-example that is a little closer to home: It's Ben's 60th birthday party. We're all gathered around, munching on fried tofu strips and organic vegetables. I raise my glass to my old friend. 'Ben,' I say, 'you've lived a long and fruitful life. We have all watched with a little envy as you have lived a life imagined and been true to yourself. Now, I was sure that Leslie would turn out to be your one true love, and if you'd snapped her up before she turned legal, your life would have certainly turned out differently. You might even have had enough money to afford to retire by now, instead of mooching off us for so long.' [cue polite laugher from the crowd]   Does this mean that I am advocating a romatic relationship between a 28-year-old adult and a 16-year-old minor? Am I coming out in favor of statutory rape? Hardly. What I am doing is speaking some comforting words to a dear friend of mine, trying to get him to reminisce about days gone by and success won and lost. Now, I am deliberately choosing a less extreme example. Segregation is wrong. Slavery is evil. There is no defending the southern white politicians or the white mobs of the 50s and 60s. But Trent Lott was toasting an old man at his BIRTHDAY PARTY, praising his past efforts, trying to make said old man think back on his life and feel content. Instead of a nice comment on an old man's accomplishments, this has exploded into a racial issue -- and the press has been pumping the bellows and tossing the gasoline cans with reckless abandon for 10 days.  Read the direct quote: '''I want to say this about my state,' Lott said at the party. ''When Strom Thurmond ran for president, we voted for him. We're proud of it. And if the rest of the country had followed our lead, we wouldn't have had all these problems over all these years either.''' (Washington Post, 7 Dec 02)  Where in that statement does Lott praise segregation? Where is the racist in the white sheet? Where does he say that the country would be better if we shipped all those dirty negroes back to Africa? Hell, the man didn't even once say 'segregation' -- much less say that the overtly segregationist policies of the Dixiecrat party were right and good and embodied all that made America great. But you wouldn't guess that reading the news stories today....  Now, here's what the press has been reporting for the past two weeks [emphasis added]: 'Senate Republican leader Trent Lott (Miss.) last night apologized for suggesting that the country would have been better off if  segregationist candidate  Strom Thurmond had been elected president in 1948.' (Washington Post, 10 Dec 02); 'Faced with an uproar over his remark that the nation would have been better off if Strom Thurmond had won the presidency  when he ran on a segregationist ticket  in 1948, Senate Republican leader Trent Lott apologized Monday night, saying he misspoke.' (USA Today, 10 Dec 02); 'Republicans are trying to regroup from the uproar caused by the  segregation statement  by Lott, of Mississippi, at an event marking South Carolina Sen. Thurmond's 100th birthday.' (Reuters, 15 Dec 02); '...Lott said Mississippians were proud to have voted for the  one-time segregationist  when he sought the White House.' (AP, 16 Dec 02); '...when Lott  praised the South Carolina Republican's segregationist run for president  in 1948.' (Boston Globe, 19 Dec 02).   And my personal favorite: 'Gore, speaking on CNN's 'Inside Politics,' said the Senate should censure Lott. 'It is not a small thing for one of the half-dozen most prominent political leaders in America to say that our problems are caused by integration and that we should have had a segregationist candidate,' he said. 'That is divisive, and it is divisive along racial lines.'' (AP, 7 Dec 02)  WHERE DID LOTT SAY THAT INTEGRATION CAUSED OUR PROBLEMS????????  What we have here is not a suddenly outed racist. What we have is a feeding frenzy, started by Democrats still stinging from the thorough trouncing they received in the mid-term elections and facilitated, even egged on, by a decidedly liberal press that has already convicted a man of racism. Yet again, I am disgusted by the blatant leftward leaning of our nation's media....          "

Bottom line, he is entitled to his opinion, politically correct or not.  The last I checked, the First Amendment was still in force.  Why does he have to resign his post?  If the Republicans want him as their leader, that is their choice.  Keep in mind that, according to a black radio show host I saw on TV the other day (Tom Joyner?), 98% of the black vote in this country goes to the Democrats.  Odds are, the voters who would vote based on only the issue of Civil Rights, already voted for the Democrats because of the perception (wrong in my opinion) that the Democrats are more dedicated to that issue.  So, what damage is there to be done by taking the black vote away?  Politically, none.         "

The efforts would thrust the administration into a debate that until now has lingered on the fringes of economic policy: Are too few wealthy Americans paying too much in taxes for too many, and should the working poor and middle class be shouldering more of the tax burden?   New Tax Plan May Bring Shift In Burden  Poor Could Pay A Bigger Share     By Jonathan Weisman Washington Post Staff Writer Monday, December 16, 2002; Page A03    As the Bush administration draws up plans to simplify the tax system, it is also refining arguments for why it may be necessary to shift more of the tax load onto lower-income workers.  Economists at the Treasury Department are drafting new ways to calculate the distribution of tax burdens among different income classes, which are expected to highlight what administration officials see as a rising tax burden on the rich and a declining burden on the poor. The White House Council of Economic Advisers is also preparing a report detailing the concentration of the tax burden on the affluent and highlighting problems with the way tax burdens are calculated for the poor.  The efforts would thrust the administration into a debate that until now has lingered on the fringes of economic policy: Are too few wealthy Americans paying too much in taxes for too many, and should the working poor and middle class be shouldering more of the tax burden?  'The increasing reliance on taxing higher-income households and targeted social preferences at lower incomes stands in the way of moving to a simpler, flatter tax system,' R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, warned at a tax forum at the American Enterprise Institute on Tuesday.  The Council of Economic Advisers' 'Economic Report to the President,' scheduled for release late next month or in early February, is to include a section arguing for new methods to calculate the distribution of tax burdens on various income groups.   The Treasury Department is working up more sophisticated distribution tables that are expected to make the poor appear to be paying less in taxes and the rich to be paying more.  Answering critics who say the working poor do face high taxes because they pay high Social Security payroll taxes, outgoing White House economic adviser Lawrence B. Lindsey told the AEI tax forum that the 12.4 percent Social Security levy should not be considered when tax burdens are calculated. Lindsey said the Social Security tax is ultimately returned to the taxpayer as a benefit.   Lindsey compared the Social Security tax to a deposit in a neighborhood bank's Christmas Club. In such clubs, periodic deposits are returned in a lump sum during the holiday season, and Lindsey said no one would consider such deposits a tax.  Early this month, J.T. Young, the deputy assistant treasury secretary for legislative affairs, lamented in a Washington Times opinion article: '[Higher] earners cannot produce the level of revenues needed to sustain the liberals' increasingly costly spending programs over the long-term. . . . If federal government spending is not controlled, then the tax burden will have to begin extending backward down the income ladder.'  The tenor of the administration's policy discussions marks a dramatic shift from early in 2001, when Bush sold his 10-year, $1.35 trillion tax cut as a tool to 'take down the tollgate on the road to the middle class,' emphasizing its beneficial impact on workers 'on the outskirts of poverty.' At that time, the administration fretted over the tax burden on the working poor, which the White House calculated to include federal income taxes, state taxes and the Social Security tax.  When administration officials pushed the need to create private investment accounts to supplement Social Security, they specifically warned that taxes paid into Social Security would not necessarily be returned unless the system was reformed.  William W. Beach, an economist at the Heritage Foundation think tank, said he was sympathetic to Lindsey's argument that the Social Security tax is not really a tax. But, he said, it was a dangerous argument for a Republican to make.  'Do I allow defense spending to offset my income taxes since I like to be defended? Do I allow road taxes to offset my profits taxes because I use the roads?' he asked. 'If you do start down that road, it's hard to see anything as taxes.'  But for the purposes of a tax reform debate, removing Social Security taxes from consideration could have a sizable impact. The top 5 percent of the nation's taxpayers paid 41 percent of all federal taxes, a hefty share, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. But that same group paid from 56 to 59 percent of all income taxes, an even more impressive burden.  'If we take out Social Security, the poor will look very lightly taxed,' said Robert S. McIntyre, of Citizens for Tax Justice, a tax research group backed by organized labor.  Democrats say the shift could prove ominous for lower-income Americans. And they appear eager for the fight.  'These people are setting the tone in saying the poor really are not being taxed enough and that the burden is too high on the rich,' said New York Rep. Charles B. Rangel, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee. 'We're going back some 70 years.'  Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Calif.), a member of the committee, said: 'I don't think there's any question you have a number of extremists in the Republican ranks that would like to see the wealthy do very well. They're going to try to make the case that the average American is overtaxed and subsidizing the poor.'  But to some conservatives, the shift is long overdue. Rep. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) has argued for two years that the nation is entering a dangerous period in which the burden of financing government is falling on too few people. In such an environment, the masses will always vote for politicians promising ever-more-generous social programs, knowing they will not have to pay for such programs, DeMint warned.  'This issue is coming to a head,' DeMint said earlier this month, just minutes after making his pitch to outgoing Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill. 'You can't maintain a democracy if the people who are voting don't care what their government costs.'  DeMint and his allies have called for a national sales tax to replace the income tax. For those below the federal poverty line, sales taxes paid would be refunded, but under the system, at least they will have seen the cost of government, he said. The working poor would accept a higher tax burden because they would be relieved of the need to file a tax return.  DeMint called his ideas 'the duck's feet under the water,' propelling his proposals forward invisibly. Conservative thinkers at the Heritage Foundation and other think tanks have begun expressing similar opinions. Last month, the Wall Street Journal editorial page made waves with an article titled, 'The Non-Taxpaying Class.'  'Workers who pay little or no taxes can hardly be expected to care about tax relief for everybody else,' the editorial stated. 'They are also that much more detached from recognizing the costs of government.'  But advocates of this new line can expect a furious backlash. Liberal commentators have already reduced the argument to an appeal to tax the poor, and even conservatives worry that the label will stick.  'It's hard to conclude it's anything else,' said the Heritage Foundation's Beach.  Michael J. Graetz, a Yale University law professor and tax reform expert, said he could not figure out where the administration's arguments are supposed to lead.  'I would be very surprised if the agenda is to put more people on the tax rolls,' he said. 'That doesn't seem like a good political agenda.'  But Democrats say that is exactly where the administration is heading. Matsui said he sees the seeds of a disastrous Republican overreach.  'The president is making the case that people who earn between $50 [thousand] and $75,000 a year should be paying a third more taxes,' Matsui said. 'I'd love to debate him on that.'  But McIntyre worried that in the marketplace of ideas, the new argument could carry the day.  'I would hope the public would find it repugnant,' he said, 'but I suppose you never know.'           "

I found him groggy and cute when he's sleepy -- not to mention sore and not a little grouchy. Been in LA for the past 2 weeks, training 600 security screeners. The Admiral who's the Federal Security Director here has gone on record saying he wants a total of 1100 trained by the end of the year, so doing the math, that means that there's another, um, carry the one, er, 500 screeners to cycle through in the next 2 weeks. Wheeeee!  Thought I'd write a bit about my day off for Benji's bene -- I was able to pull off one of my favorite things today: the Movie Theater Hat Trick!! Paid money for 'Drumline,' used my free pass (see details below) to get into 'Die Another Day,' then walked across the hall into 'Nemesis' -- an altogether entertaining way to blow an entire day!! My butt's asleep and my eyes are still adjusting to the light, but it was good to get a movie fix.  So it started at 11:00 this morning with 'Drumline.' The movie was 30 minutes late starting because the moved the theater but forgot to tell the projectionist. Oops. The entire audience was up in arms, to say the least (they didn't even turn off the flood lights in the theater until 10 minutes after the showtime) and the manager avoided a riot only by offering refunds or free passes to the entire crowd. Serendipitously, the 30 minute delay worked perfectly, as the Bond film was starting at 1:30. Once done there, 'Nemesis' was only 10 minutes from kickoff, so it was an easy jaunt across the hall!  Opinions  Drumline:  A marching band geek's wet dream. Nearly half an hour of drumline battles, marching band formations, and get-down moves. It would have been very comical if the Lee-Davis marching Confederates tried to do what these bands were hammering out, but it was fun to fantasize about belonging to a band like that. They nailed the internal band politics, too. Definitely worth matinee price, or video viewing at JS' with his monster sound system. A must see if you salivate at the sound of a drumline cadence.  Die Another Day:  I can't say enough how much I enjoy Pierce B.'s James. He manages to make him human, and gives him an edge that Connery had in the early films but Moore could never find. I truly believe that his JB is a cold-blooded killer. Halle Berry, however, never quite convinced me that she was cut from the same cloth. Not that I'm complaining, but she swishes when she moves and it prevents me from believing that she's a hard-edged operative. And Rosamund Pike makes me feel all funny inside and (heh, heheh) my pants got tight when she was on the screen....  Nemesis:  Solid, but not filling. Action-packed, but not 'Khan.' I think my lack of enthusasim is a result of a good thing -- that is, I've seen all the battle scenes on TV -- they aren't breaking ground in that department. Good, since I can get my ship-to-ship action fix on TV, but bad because it leaves me wishing I would be blown away on the big screen. Great villan for this one, but I HATED the whole Data thing. If the next one is 'Search for Data,' I quit (and you know they set that up, too)! I just can't help but think that Berman has wrung the franchise dry. Anybody keeping up with 'Enterprise,' please contradict me and convince me that I'm wrong.  That's all from the Left coast. Hope everyone has a Peaceful holiday!         "

"7247",7247,734562,"Libra","           I would have to vote for something by Blondie, Talking Heads (early), or Elvis Costello (early) -- something from the mid- to late-70s, because from 1980/1-onward New Wave changed into something slightly different.  It would be easier to choose an album, like Blondie's Parallel Lines, maybe.  That sounds more pop than, say, Costello's This Year's Model.  But to be honest, the stuff from that time period is really before my time -- I experienced more through childhood osmosis than conscious choice.  If I had to choose something from my own nascent maturity, it would be something from 79-82, after New Wave changed slightly.  From there, I'd choose Gary Numan's 'Cars' or perhaps Berlin's 'The Metro.'  Both of those lean more towards synth pop than Parallel Lines, but it's when I started to become aware of pop music, so it's a sound that has a stronger emotional appeal.         "
"7248",7248,734562,"Libra","           That's nothing! You should have heard him at 5:30 in the morning on the radio....  Ask him about backwards masking the Tiffany song!  Mir -- thank you very much for the invite, but I will have to regretfully decline as I will be in Los Angeles.  Now, Mr. Shipley:  1) Mr. McVeigh ensured a seared national psyche by getting caught -- without the pulpit of the witness stand and the magnification of the media feeding frenzy, we (Mr. and Mrs. Joe Sixpack) would never have known that a small fringe group of dissatisfied citizens feels strongly enough about the state of our nation that they would resort to such a horrific statement. Perhaps now, we can identify with the British a little better. It's always a shock to find out that someone is so dissatisfied with the status quo they react with such a base emotion as violence.  2) Christians everywhere should never, ever forget that the Bible was written by the post-Roman Empire equivalent of the white-guy-of-european-descent. If you ever want a fascinating look at politics, read up on the politics behind the formation of the New Testament. What strikes me about the whole 'in his own image' issue is what the 2000 year struggle between the teachings of Christ (love thy neighbor) and the age-old human nature (do unto your neighbor before he can do unto you) says about the image of God....  3) I disagree with you on this point -- from our comfortably 21st Century agnostic-leaning perspective, it's easy to lump everyone who wasn't a native in the Puritan camp. Religion was much stronger back then, and our Founding Fathers found it as difficult to create the institutions of our government without God's influence as we would have today building an empire sans automoblie -- it's just so pervasive that it affects everything at such a level as to be inseperable. 'But what about the separation of church and state,' you ask? The context there is the religious persecutions and bloodshed of the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries brought on by the merging of head of state and head of church (see Henry VIII's creation of the Anglican church for the start of that crap!). The Founders wanted a to ensure (wisely) that religion would not be used as state policy. They could not have envisioned a nation without God. Which is why they are all turning over in their graves at the recent 'Under God' Pledge of Allegiance debacle. 4) Couldn't agree with you more on this one. Preach on, brother! 5) Mmmm-hmmm.  6) Would you consider the citizen of an empire? 7) Seems to me the only sure way to correct the media-induced self conciousness of women is to remake society as a matriarchy. Think that would do it? 8) Uh. Yeah. Words are like cool and stuff. Heh, heheh. 9) Are you offering advice to those designing AI? Seems a basic insight that would make things better for those poor saps. 10) Is that because everything is advertising, or is that because you are a crusty old CYNICAL bastard??? 11) Next to hot fudge sundae, of course.... 12) And I am grateful for your wonderful, meandering, barely relevant insights.   P.S. Need everyone's help: I can't decide between 'What's He Got?' by The Producers and 'Talk To Ya Later' by The Tubes as an example the pinnacle of the New Wave sound. Thoughts?         "

The anger within disturbs me far more than the anger without. - I feel that the notion of God making Man in His own image is one of the most egotistical and, ultimately, tragic inventions of our species. - I think we misname our Founding Fathers by not going back far enough.  The Puritans are far more evident in our national psyche than the spirit of '76 ever was. - The only thing that will ever unify the humans species is an overwhelming threat from beyond our planet.  In that sense, space exploration and colonization is the only available evolutionary path.  Everything else will forever be violent variations of existing themes. - Love is not what someone does for you, or what you do for someone; it is persistent and mindful engagement in another's spiritual growth. - I wish to be the citizen of a nation; not the subject of an empire. - Women have a right to be angry at the media's pervasive images, but I don't know what they can do to solve it.  As soon as a coherent and effective plan is formed, I'll back it all the way. - Writing is dreaming in language.  This is why poetry is the highest form of the language arts, because in it words are pre-verbal.  Rhetoric does not occur until the mind moves the language from pre-verbal dream into the public sphere. - We think by pattern matching.

If she could see herself like this, splayed out  under a thin sheet surrounded   by shower curtains and stainless steel  and everything on wheels, she might laugh. But she is thinking now of learning to swim   in a slow, dirty river, remembering  how her brother dared her to dive  between his legs, and when she did,   how he clenched her head with his knees  and held her there thrashing,  hitting at him through the water   until there were knives in her lungs. It's cold here. She can't speak or feel or move a finger.   She can't even open her eyes. A voice  tells her morphine, a voice says curare.  It says don't worry. It will wear off soon.  This is all so normal for them they strap people down and knock people out  and string people up like this     every day. They do it to save them.  The woman waits. She thinks she has forgotten how to breathe. She hears  someone gasping from a bed  behind the curtainloud, clumsy breaths far apart, the strange deep brand of breathing   that the dying doas if to prove  they can still do it, as if the air itself  might shake them back to life.

Obviously I was just a *little* off in my understanding.  There is only one movie on the list that I have not seen (Purple Rain) and only one I don't care for (The Karate Kid - he makes Luke Skywalker seem like a mature adult).

Some random movies many consider bad or inconsequential, that I shamelessly adore:  The Cutting Edge, Dirty Dancing, Purple Rain, The Karate Kid, Caddyshack, Rocky III, Big Trouble in Little China, Smokey and the Bandit, Cannonball Run, Top Gun, St. Elmo's Fire.  Not an art film in the pack, none of them independent, and any one will please me as much as Allen, Fellini, Kurosawa, or Hitchock.         "
"7371",7371,734562,"Libra","           I have not seen the movie, and really had no intention to, but Julie wants to rent it on DVD, so we will rent it at some point.  My reason for not seeing had nothing to do with marketing or what studio produced it.  Since March of 2000, when my daughter was born, our movie watching has dropped dramatically.  Where we used to go to the movies at least every other week, it is know at most one every other month.  From memory, the movies we saw last year were Castaway, Blackhawk Down, SW:II, MIB:II, and Two Towers.  So far this year, we have seen Chicago.  So, that being said, Greek Wedding did not make it onto my extremely short list.  This is not meant to offend or insult anyone, but I find it funny that a film that was aparently not good enough for any of the major studios and became such a mainstream success as an independent film, is disliked by the people who usually like the independent films.  It kind of reminds me of what happened to U2 when most of us were in high school (and Angie still thought boys were gross).  They were liked by a few people (Ben being the one the comes to my mind), and then they got, gasp, popular, and all the people who liked them first suddenly did not want to listen to them.  Johnathan and I have pretty divergent tastes in movies.  Not necessarily in genres, but in what we find enjoyable.  I go to the movie for a couple of hours of escapism, and will usually only have problems with a film because it drags or has gaping plot holes.  From my perspective, Johnathan goes to the movies to see a well produced movie, with a solid plot.  He does not seem to be impressed with eye candy, but more so with the finer details of the film (what kind of lighting, hard vs. soft focus, camera angles, etc).  I, as a fairly mindless member of the general herd, don't notice those things unless they interfere with my enjoyment of the movie.  My general rule is that if the critics love a movie, I don't want to see it.  I have been burned too many times seeing critically aclaimed movies.  As for Jennifer's question about furniture, I have lived in Richmond for 25 years now, and have never heard of the store in question.  Now, it sounds like they make very nice, and assumed to be expensive, furniture.  I don't want to buy something for my house that I will be afraid to use because it might be damaged, especially now with three munchkins cruising around armed with juice and crayons.  So, I will buy stuff from Haynes (at one of their 'best sales ever') accepting that it is not as nice, and almost certainly will not last as long, but then be able to replace it when it wears out, and probably be able to still spend less than a nicer store.

"7373",7373,734562,"Libra","           All right now, Keeng, I never said that I hated MBFGW. I sneered at commercials because they make the screenwriting for both look unworthy of full production, and thus, wasteful. What's more insulting to the poorstarvingartist than wastefulness? (Answer: not much.) (And I apologise for not giving it a fair shake, but read on...)   I have to agree with your wry observation about successes making failures of art. I am certainly less inclined to see a movie that's gone mainstream, and yes, it is reverse snobbism. That's one of the unfortunate things that I got with my BFA: the belief that artisanally-produced projects appeal to connoisseurs, not the masses. I admit it's skewed (but tell me: How many pieces of furniture have been purchased in Richmond from Ethan Allen or Haynes or (godforbid) Target rather than at Harrison Higgins, who custom-makes beautiful solid goods right on Broad Street at Lombardy?). It's oversimplified & illogical to infer that I won't like a film because it's popularly acclaimed, yet I do it anyway, because experience has taught me that my taste isn't right in step with that of the general viewing public. Yes, I miss things. Yes, I regret the oversights when I discover & correct them. But I'm a stubborn, reactionary little human, and it's the method, although flawed, that's served me best so far.  I know: Judge not lest ye be judged....         "
"7374",7374,734562,"Libra","           You're right -- success does affect my opinion.  I mean...there was a time when I thought Titanic was the greatest American film ever made.  Changed my life.  Then it made all that money, and boy did *that* change my tune!  And how about Gladiator?  My god, what a masterpiece!  Then the success, and the awards...I see a clip from it now and I'm filled with unbridled rage.  What a crazy monkey am I!  Of course, I saw both of these, so my point is undermined....but give me some credit -- the success or failure of any work has no effect on my personal taste.  What I am reacting to is marketing -- and I will be the first to admit that my choices are affected by marketing, usually to the negative, since if I see it everywhere, all the time, and I gotta love it love it love it, as has been and continues to be shoved in my face re: Greek Wedding, I'm going to be really turned off, even if it is f*ing Citizen Kane.  That may be irrational, and it may be unfair, but it's my choice, and I'm happy to blame it on the studio, and too bad for the filmmaker who let it happen, because if an artist puts his or her foot down, it doesn't have to be that way.  I don't like being treated like a six-year-old, which is what the studio has done and continues to do, and it's a shame that what may be a fine little movie bears the brunt of my reaction, but sometimes that's just the breaks in this devil's deal we call art and commerce.  Dance too close to media saturation, and you get burned.  A lesson for artists everywhere.         "
"7375",7375,734562,"Libra","           I sort of boycotted the film mainly because I don't like 'look, it's funny 'cause their culture is different from our culture' movies.  And the ads for the series are...just...awful.  Not to mention that the main actress has a face that just makes me want to punch her.  So no, okay, you're right.  I didn't see it.   Call me close-minded. You're probably right.  But I also never saw half the Corey movies, which were all the rage at the time, and I don't really feel as though I've missed anything. Maybe I'll see it one day, but I doubt it will change my life.  Plus, with my impending nuptuals, I don't want to see a wacky 'everything's going awry' wedding movie.  My own family is mental enough as it is.         "

And it's really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really funny to see how success affects people's opinions. Who are we to be so quick to pull somebody down just because their idea worked? I saw the movie in the arthouse theatre down the street, long before it went wide and 'mainstream' -- and at the time I thought it was clever and well done. I doubt that the movie has deteriorated in quality just because it's popular  And my favorite quote from that horrible rant on SUVs that started this newest thread: 'Consider this startling fact: the SUV is the only reason the United States has been unable to comply with the Kyoto Accord on air pollution.'  Consider this startling fact: I can make up any damn fiction I want, and as long as I state that it is explicitly a fact, readers will accept it as so (especially if they are already pre-disposed to agree with said fact), even without any type of documentation to back me up.

(And yes, JLS, the damn things actually are trucks anyway.) BTW, my cousin drives one - but she bought it after she'd had not one but TWO cars totalled around her in collisions caused by SUVs, after one of which her car had to be sawed in half so that she could be extracted safely. Isn't something wrong here? Why do we have to fight evil polluters with their own oversized weapons?  And hey, aren't you mystified about MBFGW turning into a series? I mean, it's cool that they're all working, given today's economy, but isn't that stretching the idea a little thinly? The commercials make it look idiotic. It's a sitcom, I guess, but really. --And you know, I didn't see the movie, either. Didn't need to. Saw half a preview. Now I've seen the sitcom promos. I'm all set.

"7379",7379,734562,"Libra","            urlLink  Report: SUVs pose danger to cars   Congressional hearing focuses on safety   Wednesday, February 26, 2003 Posted: 1:06 PM EST (1806 GMT)    WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Congress takes its closest look at auto safety on Wednesday since the Firestone tire debacle nearly two years ago, probing the safety of sport utility vehicles.   Regulators, auto makers and consumer groups were scheduled to testify at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on rollover risks, seat belt use and other safety concerns associated with one of the most popular vehicles ever.   The spotlight will be on the nation's top auto safety regulator, Jeffrey Runge, who last month stunned the industry by criticizing SUV safety. The administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration called for meaningful and swift changes.    Concerned about deaths   Runge, an emergency room physician who will be the featured witness at the hearing, is most concerned about rollover deaths and injuries in sport utility vehicles, seat belt use, and the threat posed to smaller cars by bigger and stronger SUVs.   'SUVs inflict more harm on occupants than other cars do,' said Brian O'Neill, president of an insurance industry group that will release new statistics on SUV safety at the hearing.   The group's report, an analysis of government safety data, will show that sport utility fatality rates have fallen sharply in recent years and are now almost even with passenger cars.   But O'Neill said the analysis will also show that because of their size and weight, sport utility vehicles can cause considerable damage to smaller passenger cars in side-impact crashes.    Making their case   The auto industry aggressively defended SUV safety at a news conference on Tuesday, and plans to do the same before Senate lawmakers.   'SUVs are very safe vehicles,' said Sue Cischke, vice president of safety at Ford Motor Co. She said sport utility vehicles are under attack for some of their most noteworthy attributes.   'They do well in front crashes, side crashes and rear crashes,' Cischke said. 'Unfortunately, many people who are killed (especially in rollovers) many times are not wearing safety belts.'    Acknowledging concerns    But the industry has recently acknowledged SUV safety concerns that critics have complained about for years, and federal regulators and Congress have sharpened their focus on them.   The industry's chief lobbying group, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, has released data that auto companies agree with government figures showing the fatality rate in rollovers is three times greater for those in SUVs than for those in cars.   Auto makers have also promised to work together to reduce fatalities and injuries resulting from weight and size differences of SUVs and passenger cars. Some longer term improvements could involve design changes in one or both classes of vehicles.   The car companies are trying to head off regulation, which Runge threatened to pursue if the industry did not act voluntarily.   But some critics complain the industry is ceding a little ground now to ease pressure for new regulation and that voluntary design changes could take several years. It can take the government four years or more to approve new regulation.    Some Call For Fast Action   Joan Claybrook, a former director of the federal auto safety agency and now president of consumer group Public Citizen, says Congress should immediately mandate new rules.   'The industry has known for years about these dangers and has bobbed and weaved to avoid regulation,' Claybrook said. 'The government has also dropped the ball.'   Claybrook was also a fierce critic of industry and government action during the Firestone tire saga in which millions of tires were recalled in 2000 and 2001 after tread separations and blowouts were linked to more than 270 deaths. Most of those tires were standard equipment on Ford Explorer SUVs.   Congress passed landmark auto safety legislation after that investigation.            "

Bride To Be  Your fianc wants to have sex in a 'restricted space' with your bodies 'really close.' Where and how were you having sex before his big confession? In the middle of a football field with you in one end zone and him in the other?  The first few times you engaged him in gentle conversation, he stalled and hemmed and hawed, and you dropped the subject. If he didn't have any fantasies, he would have said so.  I'm sorry, BTB, but your fianc is NOT into bunk-bed sex. He's lying to you, dumbass. No one with a fantasy life that dull requires 'several gentle conversations' to draw him out! There's nothing the least bit shameful, gross, freaky, or repulsive about sex in a bed, bunk or otherwise. Therefore, there's only one conclusion we can draw from your boyfriend's big confession: He's hiding something.  The first few times you engaged him in gentle conversation, he stalled and hemmed and hawed, and you dropped the subject. If he didn't have any fantasies, he would have said so, but he didn't say that, did he? So he clearly has some fantasies he was too ashamed to reveal.

Something like, oh, 'I wanna have sex in a bunk bed.' Something that, if it were true, he would have told you during that first gentle conversation.  What your fianc really wants, BTB, is to be peed on or suck the snot out of your nose or blacken your eyes or wear diapers. Or all at once. Or worse. But, hey, have sex in a bunk bed if you think he's telling you the truth. You can order a cheap one from Ikea and fuck on it until it falls apartabout three fucks should do it.

"7394",7394,734562,"Libra","            urlLink BIG BABIES   SUV Killers Beg For Mercy  PITTSBURGH--For more than a decade, citizens who drive normal-size cars have been bullied, poisoned and murdered by drivers of sport utility vehicles. Now they're being asked to like it.  'Did My Car Join Al Qaeda?' asks Woody Hochswender in The New York Times. 'Where I live, about 100 miles north of New York City, at least half of all the vehicles you see on the road are SUVs or other light trucks. They make a great deal of sense. This is not just because we have plenty of long, steep driveways and miles and miles of dirt roads.'  'According to their enemies,' writes Walter Kirn in Time magazine, 'SUV drivers aren't just road hogs; they're also sociopaths who are overcompensating for deep-seated feelings of inferiority. I resent being psychoanalyzed this way. I'm after traction, not dominance, O.K.?'  The road hog set is up in arms over TV ads that call their souped-up steroidwagons anti-Christian, anti-American and pro-terrorist. SUVs have had their windows smashed in Washington, been spray-painted with anti-war slogans in Massachusetts and set ablaze by the lot full in Pennsylvania. Environmental groups sell SUV 'tickets,' and bumper stickers that read 'As a matter of fact, I do own the road,' encouraging activists to stick them on the gas hogs.  Opponents call SUVs wasteful, polluting and dangerous to other drivers. Because these fuel-inefficient leviathans now comprise a quarter of new car sales, and big models like the GMC Yukon and Chevrolet Suburban only get 12 miles per gallon, all of the air-quality improvements made during the `70s and `80s have been erased. 'But a car's miles-per-gallon rating is only one measure of fuel efficiency,' argues Hochswender. 'Miles driven is another. People who drive light trucks quickly learn not to drive around aimlessly.' He's wrong. There's zero evidence that SUV drivers drive fewer miles than other motorists. And even if some have trained themselves to eliminate frivolous miles, then driving a more efficient vehicle those lesser lengths is an opportunity for further improvement. Consider this startling fact: the SUV is the only reason the United States has been unable to comply with the Kyoto Accord on air pollution.  Even more irritating to non-SUV drivers is the sense of being pushed around--and off--the roads by 9,000-pound gorillas. No one needs the results of a formal 'crash compatibility' test to tell them that their Toyota Corolla will fair poorly in a close encounter with a Ford Expedition. The fact is you're more than twice as likely to die in a crash with an SUV than with another sedan. 'Four-wheel-drive vehicles allow workers to get to and from their jobs, and parents to transport their children safely to school, sporting events, ballet classes and the rest,' defends Hochswender. But every SUV added to the traffic on the road decreases the likelihood of someone else's kids arriving alive at school or ballet class. It's basic physics, the law of conservation of momentum to be exact. SUV drivers increase their own security at the expense of other drivers.  Ironically, it's even worse than that. SUVs not only endanger the occupants of smaller cars--they kill their own drivers in roll-overs at triple the rate of other vehicles, according to Jeffrey Runge, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  It's unfortunate if an SUV driver kills himself, but the real issue is what he does to others.  Granted, no consumer is innocent. The Gap T-shirt you buy at the mall is produced by children toiling under exploitative conditions overseas. Microsoft software is packaged by prisoner slave labor. Of course, if you were truly virtuous you'd skip even that sexy hybrid Prius and its holier-than-thou 50 m.p.g. rating and just bike to work. But it's hard to argue with Union of Concerned Scientists director Jason Mark's conclusion that, as socially-responsible purchasing decisions go, SUVs 'represent the worst.'  Short of opening a shooting range next door to a daycare center, buying an SUV is perhaps the single most antisocial act an ordinary American can commit. And as resentment against this egocentrism coalesces into anger, SUV owners are becoming defensive. Kirn again: 'Nothing takes the pleasure out of driving like the suspicion that at every four-way stop, someone in a fuel-efficient compact is sneering at my moral deficiencies. I want to scream, `But I live on a dirt road! I have a farm! See all the mud on my fenders! I need this rig!''  What I would scream back, if I met Kirn, would be this: 'What did you people do 20 years ago?' Back in the days before SUVs, farmers drove pick-ups and the rest of us drove cars. The soccer mom with a gaggle of kids drove a low stationwagon or slow minivan. Nowadays, the overwhelming majority of SUVs are plying our highways and suburban streets. Fewer than one percent will ever be driven off-road.  Why are SUV owners surprised that nobody likes them? Americans have long defined themselves by the cars they drive; is it unreasonable to assume that someone who drives an oversized gas guzzler is a selfish, aggressive lout? People buy SUVs because they're imposing, so they can see over smaller cars. Is it shocking that drivers whose sight lines are blocked by these hulking machines, and who are blinded at night by the headlights of great overbearing tailgaters, are resentful?  More and more SUV drivers are coming out of stores to find their vehicles 'keyed,' stickered or worse, and SUVs are replacing fur coats as the spray paint target of choice. Sure it sucks, but can SUV owners complain? Vandalizing property is a mere misdemeanor next to willfully endangering other people's lives and hastening the demise of the planet.  'What are we supposed to do now, turn our SUVs in?' asks Hochswender. Well, yeah. And quit whining because everybody hates you.   urlLink - Ted Rall           "

This kind of language scares and enrages me, regardless of the speaker.  Any other disagreement I have with Bush II et. al. is a matter of philosophy or economics.  As to acts of will:  I'm not sure that limiting another's options to agreeing or stepping aside is necessarily an accurate definition of non-arrogance.  Consider the State planning a freeway or landfill near one's neighborhood; it tells the residents to agree or step aside, and not to stand in the way -- after all, look at all the State does for its citizens!  Wouldn't the residents percieve such a policy as arrogant?  It seems to me that expecting (or demanding) no one to stand in one's way smacks of a kind of arrogance.  Also, I'm not convinced that acts of goodwill are points to be cashed in later when one wishes to act with abandon.  I may be wrong; perhaps in terms of history and foreign policy, they are.  Did we really defeat the Soviet Union, or did the Soviet Union fall victim to its own geography and internal corruption?  P.S.

First, the easy ones  Miriam - rest, drink fluids, and don't read Salon (Oh, sorry, that would make  me  feel better) Chris - Good luck with the interview.  Let us know how it went.  Also, congrats on the birth of your niece.  Ok, here is a very simplistic solution.  Develop real, practical, cheap, alternative energy sources.  Face it, why did we originally get involved in the Middle East?  To protect our oil interests from the Soviets.  Now we are there and can't or won't back out and let the people solve there own problems, in part, because we are dependent on the bubbling crude.  If you develop a hydrogen car (very easy in theory, tough in execution because of no infrastructure to deliver the H2), our oild demands would drop.  I would think that you could also use that technology to heat homes (reducing the need for fuel oil).  It would probably lower our nationwide demand for oil to the point that we could provide our own national requirements, or get it from non-OPEC countries.  Imagine what that would do for air quality.  If that happens, why would we stay in areas that we are not wanted and that don't serve our national interests.  That would allow us to pull out of Saudi Arabia, supposedly making the Islamic extremists happy (I'll believe that when I see it), since we would no longer be on Holy ground.  BTW, the last I knew, Prince Sultan airbase is out in the middle of the desert, not surrounding Mecca or Medina, but hey, what do I know, I'm just a Christian infidel.  Now, to reality.  Johnathan, in this case, I don't think we can negotiate on one side and use military force on the other.  Concerning Israel, we have limited military presence in Israel, probably just in the form of observers and exchange officers.  We (the US) became a target because of our support for Israel.  The option of abandoning Isreal and letting things go as the two sides want, would, to me, give the message that we will let the Arabs finish the job Hitler started.  I know that is not what you are proposing, but that is how *I* see a change in our stance playing out.  As for giving the Palestinians there own country, that sounds good in theory.  But, will Arafat or whoever is the leader use all his resources to prevent Palestine from becoming the launching point and safe haven for organizations like Hamaas and Islamic Jihad in their effort to destroy Israel?  His track record is not great so far, thus Isreal's stance on the issue, and I don't see where we can tell Isreal that they have to give up territory to an enemy that is sworn to destroy them.  Concerning Saudi Arabia, at this point, we don't have any choice but to have troops there.  Prince Sultan is an established base that is currently critical to the implending conflict.  The ironic thing is that the base was closed and our troops were removed after the Gulf War.  Then, circa 1995, the base was reopened.  You know why?  Because Iraq was proving to be less than compliant with UN requirements.  So, if Iraq becomes democratic, or, as tangentially suggested by my esteemed colleague from the great region of NOVA, the 51st state, we won't need to have troops on what is considered by some to be holy ground.  Either because they won't be needed at all or because they will be able to operate from Iraq.  In summary, I don't think we can negotiate and retaliate in this case.  Imperialist America.  I am pretty much a Hawk, but that idea does not sit well with me.  If we ever are going to have a world wide government, it must be done through peaceful means if it is to last.  Military conquest will not work, because enough people will feel oppressed to overthrow the imperialist aggressors.  Lovely Angie, you mean that there is more to America the Mickey D's and Swoosh shoes?  Man, I have been living in cave.  Seriously though, could you or Chris explain the basis of the 'arrogant conservative President' comment.  There are lots of adjectives I would agree with when describing President Bush, but arrogant is not one of them.  He expects our allies to either support us (Britain and many other European countries) or get out of the way (Canada), but definitely not stand in the wat (France-Germany).  Given all that the US has done for the world and Europe specifically in the last century (led the Allies in defeating Hitler, defeated the Soviet Union without firing a shot), I think we are entitled to at least expect the main benefactors of the US to not get in our way.  I don't care if they choose to not get involved for internal political or other reasons.  Just step aside.  I don't see that as arrogant.  Chris, there are many people around the world and quite a few in the US who don't believe that capitalism will help the raise the qulity of life in the world.  Many people still dream of socialist or communist states.  Enough rambling for now.  Lunch was supposed to be over half an hour ago.           "

Kind of ironic, when one considers how much a certain party insists on using language that suggests that they, and the country, are...the servant of God.  I feel both sides, for or against, are presenting only partially convincing arguments.  Both sound good to a point, but then they drop off into the la-la land of kneejerk idealistic political party lockstepping -- I follow along for a while, nodding in agreement, until it suddenly seems to me as if out of nowhere the proponent whips out his or her ideological dick and starts waving it around.

"7427",7427,734562,"Libra","           Ahem. Sorry I'm late for the discussion, but I had to clean up the small flood in my basement first. It might not surprise any of you that I have some thoughts about the upcoming conflict and the issues surrounding it.  Let me apologize in advance, as this is going to be long as crap, but bear with me (I've been thinking a lot about these issues lately -- time is about the only thing my  unemployed ass can afford these days).  First, though, I have but one word for the way the Bush Administration has handled foreign policy since the collapse of the Taliban in Afghanistan:   Amateurish . If you don't like that one, here're some other choices: sloppy, slapdash, clumsy, crude, slipshod, inept, bungling, or incompetent.  The Model UN Conference that I attended in 1992 at Princeton would have produced more elegant diplomacy than that of the leadership of the current administration. I have been continuously amazed and dismayed at the ineptitude with which this administration has conducted foreign policy. Bush II sold his soul (with the tacit approval of the Republican National Committee) to the conservatives in 2000 in order to win South Carolina and staunch the grassroots support that was propelling John McCain to the Republican nomination. Woe to the future of our country as a result, for the very same conservatives that now have a hotline to the Oval Office (or perhaps more importantly, to Carl Rove's office) and they are giving our reputation as thorough a drubbing as Clinton did back in 92-93. The ham-handed and despicably snotty attitude with which this administration has approached the rest of the world has directly lead to the worst crisis in NATO history and an intransigent and increasingly hostile UN. I was relieved to see that I wasn't the only one of this opinion last Sunday -- read this article:  Forceful Tactics Catch Up With U.S.  Turns out that the US is only reaping what it was sown over the past 2 years, starting with our disgraceful behavior re: the Kyoto Accord and going downhill from there. (Some of you might remember my support for our withdrawal from the ABM Treaty -- mind you, I still think that we did the right thing -- just in a terribly wrong fashion....)  So, registering my strong, nay intense, disapproval for the manner in which Mr. Bush II conducts his foreign policy, let me now tell you why going to war is not only right, but in the best interests of the US in the long-run: lubing the wheels of regime change in Iraq means the difference between John and Johnathan's nightmarish and ultimately impossible proposal of utterly annihilating all extremists in order to live peacefully, and influencing the world in such a positive manner that extremists will be relegated to John's desert, where they can do little harm.   But first we must set aside all of the emotional and bleeding heart baggage in order to discuss  realpolitik  in a form Cardinal Richelieu would immediately recognize and approve. So, let's set aside the fact that war is destructive and killing people is wrong -- that's a given. Set aside the wrong-headed argument that this is about oil -- 1) unless you are living in a cabin in the wilderness without electricity and  any  modern convenience, you  must  accept the fact that oil is the lifeblood of our modern society and therefore securing a stable and cheap source incontrovertibly benefits all of us; and 2) If oil was on Bush II's mind, we would invade Venezuela, whose crisis has posed a more serious oil problem for the United States than Iraq ever could. Set aside the fact that this whole thing with Iraq feels like 'You beat up on my dad by defying him, so I'm gonna beat up on you...' -- since the hawks of Bush II's administration were all veterans of Bush I, we can assume that that  certainly  had a lot to do with choosing Iraq as the next target after the Taliban folded like a cheap card table. Johnathan, the reason you noticed the link between terrorism and Iraq has been downplayed is because  there isn't one.  Regardless of all of these issues, there are compelling reasons for us to go to war in the desert again.  So let's talk geopolitics: On the day the war ends (and I'm not taking a big leap by assuming that we win), then the  entire geopolitics of the region will be redefined . Every country bordering Iraq will find not the weak formations of the Iraqi army along their frontiers, but US and British troops. We will be able to reach into any country in the region with covert forces based in Iraq, and we could threaten overt interventions as well. We will not need permission from regional hosts for the use of facilities, so long as either Turkey or Kuwait will permit transshipment into Iraq. In short, a U.S. victory will change the entire balance of power in the region, from a situation in which the US must negotiate its way to war, to a situation where we are free to act as we will.   If we consider the post-Iraq war world, it is no surprise that the regional response ranges from publicly opposed/privately not displeased to absolute opposition. Certainly, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Iran (and Jordan, to a lesser extent) have nothing to gain from a war that will be shaped entirely by the United States. Kuwait and Turkey are the other countries bordering Iraq, and they are in the US camp already. Syria, Saudi Arabia and Iran have been banking on European resistance to a war to prevent it. It remains to be seen if that can happen -- personally, I think that Bush II will pull the trigger no matter what the UN decides in the end. And the rest of NATO has already come out in support -- magnifying the split within the European Union between the big nations and the small (Germany and France vs. everyone else). And don't even get me started on my opinions about why France is opposing the war.... The European split -- and the real possibility that France and Germany ultimately will endorse war in some way in order to reap the not insubstantial benefits of rebuilding Iraq -- mean that war cannot be prevented. Saddam will not abdicate or be overthrown until the war is well under way. Therefore, it is highly likely that the war will take place, the US will occupy Iraq, and that the map of the Middle East will change profoundly.  The Bush II administration is well-aware that its increased presence in the region will result in greater hostility. However, we should view this rising cost as acceptable so long as Washington is able to redefine the behavior of countries neighboring Iraq. In the long run, though, geopolitical power will improve US security interests in spite of growing threats. To be more precise, Islamic hostility at a certain level as a given, and does not regard an increase in that hostility as materially affecting its interests.  The conquest of Iraq will not be a minor event in history: It will represent the introduction of a new imperial power to the Middle East and a redefinition of regional geopolitics based on that power. The US will move from being an outside power influencing events through coalitions, to a regional power that is able to operate effectively on its own. Most significant, countries like Saudi Arabia and Syria will be living in a new and quite unpleasant world. And, perhaps more importantly, it will offer the opportunity to create a democratic state in the Middle East that actually works. A place where democracy and capitalism are afforded the opportunity to grow and flourish. And this, more than any other reason, is why it's important for us replace Saddam by any means necessary.   Because this gets down to the root of the issue, as JS has urged us to do.  It comes down to this: Where there is globalization and economic opportunity, John and Johnathan's extremists are forced into the proverbial desert. Where there is economic stagnation and political repression, and the extremists not only operate in the open, but they are a powerful force in that society. So, rebuilding Iraq  a la   Germany after WWII is not only good morality, but it is solid strategic vision.  If you have the chance, get your hand on a copy of the 1 March edition of Esquire Magazine. Inside, you will find an article written by Thomas Barnett entitled: 'The Pentagon's New Map. It Explains Why We're Going To War, And Why We'll Keep Going To War.' If you cannot find this article, I have an electronic version I will be glad to email you. It is very important that everyone reads and understands this new paradigm -- remember that the world is an inherently more dangerous place since the end of the Cold War, and this theory goes a long, long way to help us to understand the situation in the world and our place in it. Here are the first couple of paragraphs, which mirror my thoughts exactly:  'Let me tell you why military engagement with Saddam Husseins regime in Baghdad is not only necessary and inevitable, but good.   When the United States finally goes to war again in the Persian Gulf, it will not constitute a settling of old scores, or just an enforced disarmament of illegal weapons, or a distraction in the war on terror. Our next war in the Gulf will mark a historical tipping point the moment when Washington takes real ownership of strategic security in the age of globalization.   That is why the public debate about this war has been so important: It forces Americans to come to terms with I believe is the new security paradigm that shapes this age, namely, Disconnectedness defines danger. Saddam Husseins outlaw regime is dangerously disconnected from the globalizing world, from its rule sets, its norms, and all the ties that bind countries together in mutually assured dependence.   The problem with most discussion of globalization is that too many experts treat it as a binary outcome: Either it is great and sweeping the planet, or it is horrid and failing humanity everywhere. Neither view really works, because globalization as a historical process is simply too big and too complex for such summary judgments. Instead, this  new world must be defined by where globalization has truly taken root and where it has not.    Show me where globalization is thick with network connectivity, financial transactions, liberal media flows, and collective security, and I will show you regions featuring stable governments, rising standards of living, and more deaths by suicide than murder. These parts of the world I call the Functioning Core, or Core. But show me where  globalization is thinning or just plain absent, and I will show you regions plagued by politically repressive regimes, widespread poverty and disease, routine mass murder, and most important the chronic conflicts that incubate the next generation of global terrorists. These parts of the world I call the Non-Integrating Gap, or Gap.'  Let me know if anyone wants to read the rest of this article  its incredibly enlightening.  So  JS and John  it doesnt have to come down to either/or.          "
"7428",7428,734562,"Libra","           Sadly, I think you are right in the solution of wiping all extremists out, but that will not happen, nor should it.  There must be some way to get throught the hatred that prevents them from accepting anything but their total victory.  If OBL wants to sit in the middle of the desert and preach hatred of the Zionists and their lackeys (USA), I have no problem with that until the hatred crosses the line and becomes violent action.  Then, I see it as a simple matter of survival.         "
"7429",7429,734562,"Libra","           Clarification:  I do not define appeasement by addressing an attacker's complaints while simultaneously exacting wholesale and decisive retaliation for that individual's attack, which is the argument I am making.  If, however, there is no way at all to address the attacker's concerns, I argue that there is no option but to wipe out the entire ideology.  Because the ideological warrior cannot be deterred, ever, as long as he or she exists.  I hesitate to use the word 'ideology,' because a counter-argument could be made re: Communism, which one could argue was a deterred ideology -- but I feel any attempt to compare radical Muslim fundamentalism to Communism is foolish, so I'll let it stand.  Waiting out a political, economic, and social movement is far different from waiting out an opponent who is following the words of the one and only Creator of all that exists.  It sounds as if those who support reacting to the deed without addressing the reason, do so because there is, in fact, no way to address the reason.  Since I would rather not see a future in which We and They are locked in violent conflict until the end of our species, it seems to me that within these restrictions, we must wipe out all violent Muslims, everywhere, and strike them from the historical record.  Given these restrictions, that seems to be the only remaining option for a lasting peace for this and future generations.  Please, someone convince me that there is hope to be found in reacting to the deed and not the reason.  The argument and consequences as I understand them reveal to my eyes a future of unending violence, bloodshed, and death upon death upon death.         "

"7434",7434,734562,"Libra","           If I am understanding you correctly, you think the heart of their hatred for the USA is related to our support for Israel and the presence of troops in Saudi Arabia.  That may be, but there are problems with simplisticly removing the sources of their anger.    Keep in mind that Israel was founded by the UN in 1947 or 1948.  Yes, the existing inhabitants (now known as Palestinians, though there was not a Palestine at that time)were forced out of their homes, but you could (and I am very hesitant to do so because of the obvious implications to the US concerning Native American Indians) point out that the Israelis were driven out of that land that had been theirs for 2000 years.  Additionally, the occupied territories were occupied because the Arab countries have attacked Israel 2 or 3 times and lost.  Israel took those lands to offer additional protection from future attack.  I could be wrong, but I think that technically, a state of war still exists between Israel and Syria, meaning that Israel would be idiotic to surrender the Golan Heights (very strategic land) back to Syria.  In the ultimate irony, the radical Palestinians and Arabs want to drive the Israelis into the sea and exterminate them.  Do you recall the fighting in Kosovo a few years ago?  The Serbs (Christians) were trying to wipe out the Kosovars (Muslims).  Kind of ironic that we (USA/NATO) stopped the ethnic cleansing there, yet religiously related people want us to turn a blind eye and let them wipe out Jews.  As for Saudi Arabia, we may be 'spoiling' sacred lands in the eyes of some Muslims, but we are there at the request and with the permission of the Saudi Royal Family (government).  If the extermists want us gone that bad, then they should petition for a change in their governments policy.  We don't generally stay where the government does not want us to be.  Caving in to the actions of terrorists will set a very bad example for future events.  What happens when the hypothetical pure Islamic nation existis, stretching from Tunisia to Pakistan and Turkey to Sudan, and they then decide that their Eurpoean  or Indian neighbors are living the corrupt lives of infidels.  Given the past effectiveness of their terroristic activities, they will try them again, seeing weakness.  As with most things, there are no simple answers, and I have no grandiose ideas.  But, appeasement does not work.  Just ask Neville Chamberlain.         "
"7435",7435,734562,"Libra","           If we don't have anything the fire ants want, they go away.  Eliminate the reason.  If we want to get our Retaliation Jones on, eliminate the reason while simultaneously taking out a few nests.  But if we don't eliminate the reason, we have to exterminate all fire ants, everywhere, for all time, faster than they can respond.    Another argument that has been added to the original one:  terrorists act out of hatred of liberty.  For crying out loud.  They act out because they want something to change, somewhere.  We may agree or disagree with that thing they want changed, and we can certainly be angry about their method, but don't avoid the issue by saying they're just mean people.  There is such a thing as kleptomania, and I can imagine a thrill in the act, but in general people steal things because they want them.  All the alarms and police in the world won't stop thieves until everyone has what they want.  Of course, meeting everyone's material desires is impossible.  But we can *combine* deterrents (police, locks, alarms) with strategies that target the cause:  we can educate people in how to get jobs, and show them the rewards of individual work -- both in material wealth and individual pride.  Our country does fairly well with this; I feel confident there is less stealing here than in, say, poor South American cities where there is a lot of law enforcement (though corrupt), no path to education and no honor in a hard day's work or in providing for a family.  My point being, arguing that people steal because they want things, can lead to nearly comprehensive solutions.  But arguing that people steal because they're evil -- what could that approach possibly solve?  Terrorists hate America not because they hate liberty -- I'm sure some of the 9/11 hijackers enjoyed a few shopping malls on the sly -- but because of clear (to them) wrongs that have been committed.  Ignore their reasons in the response, and they keep on coming.  Paint over those reasons with a gloss of 'They hate liberty!  They hate freedom!', and Joe Dimwit Public will happily welcome black+white villains he can zap with his ray gun.  See, the argument has kept roaming farther and farther afield of critical thinking.  Instead of smoking out terrorists, sometimes by force, we're told that we're attacking evil people who hate liberty and freedom.  I still feel there's a strong argument to be made for war -- but somewhere it got lost when we all started wrapping ourselves in the flag and the righteous justice of Almighty God.  P.S.

"7439",7439,734562,"Libra","           To clarify:  I said the Bush administration *had* a strong case, but exchanged it for weaker one.  Based on the original argument, I support a (brief and decisive) war with full and fair closure for Iraq.  The second (and current) argument, which has added that Saddam is evil to his people, that Iraq as a country is a direct threat to us, that we want to rescue the Iraqi people, is nonsense to me; there are many evil leaders, Iraq is an *in*direct threat by way of terrorists (re: original argument), and there are millions of people all over the world who are oppressed whom we don't 'rescue.'  To me, these arguments fail to support war, and adding them to the original argument has clouded the issue and left me unsatisfied.  I am left supporting the war for a compelling reason that has since been buried under what sells on TV.  I feel like I'm at a football game where I'm cheering for my school because I want us in the championships, while everyone around me is cheering for my school because they hate the opposing coach.  I don't care about the other coach.  I can't join in and cheer as loudly under those conditions.  As to the argument that terrorists will keep coming at us until we make it unsafe for them to operate, etc.:  as I stated before, I believe this is only half right.  If fights break out at the roadhouse because everyone's high on drugs, and we respond by arresting everyone and shutting down the roadhouse, sure there will be no more fights.  But the drugs will move to another roadhouse.  And we don't have the resources nor the will to eliminate all roadhouses, then all bars, then all clubs, then, then, then....  If we don't address the reason in some way, the only sure solution is the arresting or killing of all violent Muslims, throughout the world.  Good luck managing that.  This enemy isn't a Nazi government, a country to be contained.  They're individual people, full of anger they feel is justified, who can wander about freely like ants.  It would be mighty (darkly) funny if we elminated all WMD throughout the world, and the day after we declared victory, some random fellow got lucky and piloted a hijacked airliner into the Lake Anna nuclear plant.  For that matter, after WMDs are eliminated, what's next -- fertilizer?

"7440",7440,734562,"Libra","           I'm sure this will surprise few (if any) of you.  I support the impending conflict.  I have a hard time calling it a war for two reasons.  First, Congress will not declare war.  Second, just as the Tampa Bay Bucaneers playing Lee-Davis High School is not a football game, the US military versus the remnants of the Iraqi military is not a war.  Given the tenacity of the Israelis, I think they could defeat Iraq in a conventional fight.  Those last two words are the key to me.  Both Johnathan and Miriam have said that the Bush administration has not made a strong case for going to war with Iraq.  I have no doubt that Iraq has WMD.  Probably not nuclear, as nuclear material has a habit of leaving a foot print, but biological and chemical are much harder to track.  I have no doubt that our intelligence agencies, embarassed and pissed off about their gaffes pre-September 11, 2001, have sources and proof of these WMD.  For two reasons (alerting Sadaam of what we know and having him move them and protecting our intelligence sources), we have not come out and said 'OK, over here they have 2 tons of Anthrax, and over there they have 500 gallons of VX.  There are weapons that Iraq previously admitted having that are unaccounted for.  That is scary.  It would not take much for Sadaam to give these things to Osama and his buddies, if it meant hurting the US.  Yes, Sadaam is considered an infidel by OBL.  I'm sure Sadaam considers OBL a madman (funny, when you think about Sadaam's mental state).  They don't like each other, true.  But, their hatred of us (and western culture in general) is greater.  The enemy of my enemy is my friend (for now).  Why do you think we supported Iraq in their war against Iran?  Because we thought Sadaam was a righteous dude?  Heck no.  It was because our choices of opposition to Iran (who was holding the hostages) were extremely limited (the Soviet Union, like that would happen, and Afghanistan, who, oh by the way, had been invaded by the Soviet Union.  So, we made a deal with the devil in the name of trying to get our people back.  So, if OBL sent Sadaam a message saying he had a way to get a WMD into NYC, DC, or LA, don't you think he would give OBL whatever was needed to deliver it there?  I agree, peace and diplomacy should always be the first option, but we have had 12 years of defiance of the terms Sadaam agreed to as part of the end of the Gulf War.  That is the difference between 'defying' an optional treaty that you didn't sign (Kyoto and the International War Crimes) versus a treaty that was part of the terms of your surrender.  How much longer are we supposed to give him to comply?  At what point do we say enough is enough?  When a city disappears in a mushroom cloud or a VX bomb goes of in Central Park?  Three thousand people were killed a year and half ago by Islamic extremists.  They will keep coming at us until we make it unsafe for them to operate anywhere in the world and give them no support structure supplying weapons and money.  Now, if it ends up that Iraq does not have WMD, you will see a huge backlash against Bush, and Edwards/Kerrey/Clinton/Gephardt will be the next president.  That, quite frankly, scares the hell out of me.  But, if the peoples trust is broken, Bush will not survive politically.         "
"7441",7441,734562,"Libra","           Regardless of one's opinion regarding Iraq, it is undeniable that should individuals or groups decide to retaliate, it will be us -- you, me, our families, our friends -- who will be the favored target.  We -- the citizens of this country -- are about to be enlisted in a cause for which we may die.  Not the soldiers, not the pilots, not the marines -- us.  The question is not are you willing to sacrifice the professional soldiers for this cause -- but are you willing to sacrifice yourself, on the battlefield of the shopping mall or apartment building?  Are you willing to trade the life of your three-year-old so that peace will prevail?  Because the Apache helicopter is awfully hard to hit.  But a playground, now -- right down the road from you -- that's easy pickings.  I suspect a great many people have not made the logical connection from the desert waaaaay over there to their own office building.  Sure, we watched the WTC fall; we watched the people jumping from windows.  But it is human nature to believe oneself immortal; to believe it's all a video game.  Which it is, until the stage catches fire and the night club is filling with smoke and you're reminded that Hey, dude, this is, like, real.  This posting is not for or against the war -- just a reminder that a vote for it is a tacit acceptance of the possibility that the cost of the goal will not be professional soldiers, but your niece, burned or gassed or diseased or shot.  Granted, one may feel that is going to happen anyway, so what the hell.  And a valid argument can be made for that.  I just hope our eyes are open.  Wide.         "

"7443",7443,734562,"Libra","           from an article in the washington post No definitive price tag or time limit has been put on the plan, and officials stressed that much remains unknown about the length of a potential conflict, how much destruction would result, and 'how deep' the corruption of the Iraqi government goes. The administration has declined to estimate how long U.S. forces would remain in Iraq. Undersecretary of State Marc Grossman told Congress last week that it might be two years before the Iraqis regained administrative control of their country. But 'they're terrified of being caught in a time frame,' said retired Army Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, one of a number of senior military and civilian experts who have been briefed by the Pentagon on the plan. 'My own view is that it will take five years, with substantial military power, to establish and exploit the peace' in Iraq.           "
"7444",7444,734562,"Libra","           op ed from the ny times February 21, 2003 The Martial Plan By PAUL KRUGMAN    he Marshall Plan was America's finest hour. After World War I, the victors did what victors usually do: they demanded reparations from the vanquished. But after World War II America did something unprecedented: it provided huge amounts of aid, helping both its allies and its defeated enemies rebuild.   It wasn't selfless altruism, of course; it was farsighted, enlightened self-interest. America's leaders understood that fostering prosperity, stability and democracy was as important as building military might in the struggle against Communism.   But one suspects that our current leaders would have jeered at this exercise in 'nation-building.' And they are certainly following a very different strategy today.  It's not that the Bush administration is always stingy. In fact, right now it is offering handouts right and left. Most notably, it has offered the Turkish government $26 billion in grants and loans if it ignores popular opposition and supports the war.   Some observers also point out that the administration has turned the regular foreign aid budget into a tool of war diplomacy. Small countries that currently have seats on the U.N. Security Council have suddenly received favorable treatment for aid requests, in an obvious attempt to influence their votes. Cynics say that the 'coalition of the willing' President Bush spoke of turns out to be a 'coalition of the bought off' instead.  But it's clear that the generosity will end as soon as Baghdad falls.  After all, look at our behavior in Afghanistan. In the beginning, money was no object; victory over the Taliban was as much a matter of bribes to warlords as it was of Special Forces and smart bombs. But President Bush promised that our interest wouldn't end once the war was won; this time we wouldn't forget about Afghanistan, we would stay to help rebuild the country and secure the peace. So how much money for Afghan reconstruction did the administration put in its 2004 budget?  None. The Bush team forgot about it. Embarrassed Congressional staff members had to write in $300 million to cover the lapse. You can see why the Turks, in addition to demanding even more money, want guarantees in writing. Administration officials are insulted when the Turks say that a personal assurance from Mr. Bush isn't enough. But the Turks know what happened in Afghanistan, and they also know that fine words about support for New York City, the firefighters and so on didn't translate into actual money once the cameras stopped rolling.   And Iraq will receive the same treatment. On Tuesday Ari Fleischer declared that Iraq could pay for its own reconstruction ?even though experts warn that it may be years before the country's oil fields are producing at potential. Off the record, some officials have even described Iraqi oil as the 'spoils of war.'   So there you have it. This administration does martial plans, not Marshall Plans: billions for offense, not one cent for reconstruction.   Of course, postwar reconstruction in Europe and Japan wasn't just a matter of money; America can also be proud of the way it built democratic institutions. Alas, the Bush administration's postwar political plans are even more alarming than its economic nonchalance.   Turkey has reportedly been offered the right to occupy much of Iraqi Kurdistan. Yes, that's right: as we move to liberate the Iraqis, our first step may be to deliver people who have been effectively independent since 1991 into the hands of a hated foreign overlord. Moral clarity!   Meanwhile, outraged Iraqi exiles report that there won't be any equivalent of postwar de-Nazification, in which accomplices of the defeated regime were purged from public life. Instead the Bush administration intends to preserve most of the current regime: Saddam Hussein and a few top officials will be replaced with Americans, but the rest will stay. You don't have to be an Iraq expert to realize that many very nasty people will therefore remain in power ?more moral clarity! ?and that the U.S. will in effect take responsibility for maintaining the rule of the Sunni minority over the Shiite majority.  If this all sounds incredibly callous and shortsighted, that's because it is. But then what did you expect? This administration doesn't worry about long-term consequences ?just look at its fiscal policy. It wants its war; there's not the slightest indication that it's interested in the boring, expensive task of building a just and lasting peace.

"7453",7453,734562,"Libra","           hmmm.. why i'm against the war with iraq.  1. there seems to be no defined reason why we are specifically going to war with iraq as opposed to any other nation.  they are other countries which have violated u.n. sanctions and decrees (here in the us we simply don't sign the agreements or ignore them) 2. iraq is not a genuine threat to u.s. interests - which violates the powell doctrine (colin powell) that the u.s. should only enter a war when u.s. interests are clearly at stake - he bases that philosophy on his experiences in vietnam. 3. there is limited public support for this war.  a war without public support is not likely to get the funding it needs to be successful. 4. yes, of course, we could win the war against iraq if all we wanted to do was to bomb it and then leave.however,  bush has said that there will be a regime change.  this will require years of occupation by the u.s. military in order to have a peaceful transition - if one is possible.  after an u.s. invasion - it is likely that muslim fundamentalist will be the most organized and well-funded group in iraq. 5. assuming the u.s. does win this war, the kurds, which at this time mainly occupied the u.n. controlled northern half of iraq, would demand their own country.  this would cause unrest in turkey which has a sizeable kurdish population.  turkey would not want to give up land or anything else to the kurds - the kurds are considered 'terrorists' in turkey. 6. as mr. wigglepants pointed out, this also does not solve any of the problems that exist in the middle east.  the islamic population will still believe that the u.s. is occupying muslim lands and should leave.  the palestinians  will still not have a homeland.  the israelis will still be hated by the rest of the middle eastern community.   7. war is wrong unless it is the absolute last resort - diplomacy is still an option. 8.  what gives the u.s. the right to dispose of a leader?  and why just saddam hussein?  where does it go from here?  9. how does this fight the war on terrorism?  will we be safer after this?

I think that second marketplace that was hit (the one that killed 50+ Iraqi civilians) was planted by Iraqi security forces -- the timing was too convenient, and they didn't do anything to restrict reports from reporting on it -- even better -- they  encouraged  reporters to go there and see for themselves.

It is smart to be afraid of labor unions; it is stupid to be afraid of corporations.  It is smart to be afraid of our nuclear arsenal; it is stupid to be afraid of public health care.

The documentary maker won his first Oscar for Bowling for Columbine, but he brought the other nominees on stage with him in what he called a show of solidarity for nonfiction during these fictitious times.   We live in the time where we have fictitious election results that elect a fictitious president, Moore said. We live in a time where we have a man who's sending us to war for fictitious reasons, whether it's the fiction of duct tape or the fiction of orange alerts.   Applause gave way to some boos, as the orchestra began playing to cue the filmmaker to leave the stage.   We are against this war, Mr. Bush. Shame on you, Mr. Bush. Shame on you, Moore shouted.   Afterward, host Steve Martin tried to restore levity.   It was so sweet backstage, you should have seen it, Martin joked. The Teamsters were helping Michael Moore into the trunk of his limo.   Bowling for Columbine was Moore's exploration of gun violence in America. The title refers to the fact that gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold went bowling before they opened fire at Columbine High School in Colorado, killing 12 students and a teacher before turning the guns on themselves.   Asked backstage why he made the remarks, Moore answered: I'm an American.   Is that all? a reporter asked.   Oh, that's a lot, Moore responded.   He dismissed the jeers he received, telling reporters: Don't report that there was a split decision in the hall because five loud people booed.   The rotund, scruffy-bearded activist from Flint, Mich., also directed the 1989 documentary Roger & Me, in which he pursued former General Motors Corp. boss Roger Smith to confront him about the collapse of the auto industry in Moore's hometown.   He's also the author of the best-selling book Stupid White Men ... And Other Sorry Excuses for the State of the Nation, which criticizes American politicians for favoring corporate wealth over public well-being.   Scattered appeals for peace and grim reports from the U.S.-led war in Iraq added a sober contrast to Hollywood's traditional night of glitzy self-glorification.   In light of all the troubles in this world, I wish us all peace, Chris Cooper said during his acceptance speech for best supporting actor for Adaptation.   Cooper was among several nominees, including Meryl Streep and Martin Scorsese, who wore dove peace pins on their formal wear as a silent statement about the war          "

I kind of liked J Lo's sea-foam mumu.  It was very 70's and fun to me.  I liked that Nicole Kidman and Susan Sarandon had dresses with similar necklines...it was so faux pas, and it made me laugh to think that they might have seen each other and said, 'Shit!' when they got there.    Yes, I'm breaking up with Johnathan and moving to wherever it is that Adrian Brody lives, a location unknown to me, as I have never actually met him and I am totally kidding.  That's just sort of the Angie way of saying that I really like him.  Kind of like how Liv Tyler and Angelina Jolie are my girlfriends.    Oh, and by the way, I've decided that I did not like the color that Julia Roberts had dyed her hair.  It didn't do anything for her skin tone.  And Kate Hudson's hair, skin and dress were all the same color...she looked like a walking tan with lips.  It was a little strange.  I thought Diane Lane looked fabulous though.  And I think Catherine Zeta-Jones is just so cute when she's pregnant.  The only acting I've ever seen her do that I really liked was 'Zorro' and 'Traffic,' so I'm not like a huge fan or anything, but she makes a darn tootin' cute lil pregnant lady.    I worry that Julianne Moore will suffer from Meryl Streep Syndrome and be nominated a jillion times and not win (although Meryl did win two, but that was 20+ years ago, and she's been nominated MANY more times since).

Let's see, there is (in order of hardest to easiest) 3) Venezuela - Right in the middle of extreme labor unrest, very close to the US.  Would not require as much in the way of a logistics train.  (As a side note, Venezuela is the main reason we have had the price spikes in gas.  They are still only operating at 20% of their normal petroleum output).  2)  Saudi Arabia - We already have more troops in Saudi than they do and we have 250,000 in Kuwait.  It would take like 2 days to 'conquer' them.  And the easiest is 1)Kuwait - Our military is already there.  We could just claim victory and take hold of some of the richest oil fileds in the world.  Of course, the domestic option is drilling in ANWAR, but we know that won't happen.         "

I cannot speak re: time and the recent inspections because they were not executed in a way I felt effective; their flawed methods rendered them inconsequential; thus, time was irrelevant.  3. I believe that in general, lasting self-governance cannot be forced; it can only be chosen.  I say 'in general' because I don't believe in absolutes; there is always the possibility of an exception.

I'm not much into the recent (last 20 years) jazz.  As a whole, American attempts at orchestral music (movie soundtracks not included) have been pathetic.  Bernstein had some attempts at 'good' orchestral music (Candide Overture).  Copland was the best American composer in my opinion.  But, you can't beat 'the continent' for good classical music.  From Bach through Beethoven to Tchaikovsky (yeah, Russian, but close enough), they had some incredible talent.  I guess what it comes down to is I will admit that, as a whole, European culture, which is after all what all the things we are talking about make up, is better than American.  Hell, we can't even make a decent beer.  I still prefer living in the heathen US, wearing my holy blue jeans, ratty old t-shirt, eating my cheeseburger, deep fried potatoe strips, and watching American football on TV, or better yet, laughing at some of the ugly dresses the actresses wear to all the awards shows.

Loreal is a makeup company, but it's a parent company to other professional salon hair and make-up products as well...Laurent is a fashion designer, who might specialize in leather goods, and Gotier is actually spelled Gautier or something...he's also a designer.  Does a lot of stuff for Madonna, I think.  Anywho, leather goods, hair & makeup (and fragrance) AND clothes are all parts of 'fashion,' which is why I lumped them all together.  For example, Calvin Klein also has a line of cosmetics and cologne, as well as shoes, underwear, clothing, etc.  Croissants are extremely bad for you.  But they're oh-so tasty.  I hold that the reason why European nations like France and Italy aren't obese despite all of the foods they eat is this:  lifestyle.  They relax.  Work is not what defines them like it is in the U.S.  They take their time in preparing their food, eating their food, living their lives.  They have siesta.  They are not so focused on making money and working hard as they are living and enjoying life and each other.  And I think that lowered stress level really does a lot in terms of how they look.  I think we as Americans are always go go go...eating instant foods, full of preservatives, shoving them in our gullets as quickly as possible so we can go go go some more.  We're all fat because we don't digest.  And we don't sleep and rest as we should, so our bodies don't metabolize the same way.  Our work ethic is very different from theirs.    And this is not to say that one way is better than the other.  We make LOTS more money here because of our Protestant work ethic.  It's part of what makes us a capitalist nation.

What does that say about us?'  It says we follow through on our word.  President Bush warned the Iraqi soldiers to not attempt to sabotage the oil reserves because it belonged to the Iraqi people not Saddam and his regime.  The revenues the oil can create would be neccessary for the Iraqis to rebuild their country.  This said, there was a plan in place to protect the Oil Ministry and the oil fields for the benefit of the Iraqis.    Alternately, there was not neccessarily a plan to protect other specific places, because who knew where the certain chaos that was to follow would erupt.  What were they supposed to do anyway, shoot the unarmed civilians?  That would have been all they could have done to stop it.  The crowds were enormous that were taking part in the looting.  The Liberals would have been screaming then that the innocent, unarmed looters had been shot!  Unfortunately, the looting happened, but it was bound to happen.  But, I'm sorry, protecting a museum was probably the last thing on the minds of the soldiers as they were watching there backs for remnants of the Republican Guard or the Fedayeen...         "

"7596",7596,734562,"Libra","           Perhaps the problem lies in our language.  In general, we have two words to describe a body type:  thin/fat; tall/short/; etc.  We are a culture of extremes and linguistically-enforced simplicity.  Our language is so pitiful that we often resort to numbers to express ourselves ('Are you happier today?' 'In terms of happy I'm about a 6, maybe a 7.')  For all the praise Indo-European languages receive, more often than not our choices are woefully limited.  Unfortunately, being creatures of language, how we speak and communicate greatly shapes our reality.  And so the wars begin -- often because our limited language limits our thinking, and thus our options.  No poetry, no grace -- only simple, concrete linguistic containers into which we attempt to pour the whole of our experience.  I love my car.  I love my wife.  I hate this pizza.  I love my house.  I love this carpet.  I hate that tie.  I hate war.  I hate flying.  I love my parents.  I hate the quiet.  For crying out loud.         "

Second, compared to the other two women in the group, Natalie Maines *is* the fat one.  She is not fat.  But, she is heavier than the other two.  When comparing a group of people, men are generally vague in their descriptions.  For example, if I were trying to describe something about that pipcture to another friend who was familiar with it but not their names, I would use the following descriptions - the brunette, the skinny blonde, and the fat or chubby blonde.  I will agree that she is not fat, but it is a comparitive tool.  I could just as easily use short and tall I suppose, but that is not a sure thing since one appears to be standing and the other is kneeling on an elevated platform (I think).

We left her with him for 2 days to flush out her system with IV fluids.  For about a week after the treatment, she was fine.  We had switched her to a special kidney friendly food.

What interests me is if (a) the world community is responsible for the protection and preservation of specific nation's antiquities, and if so, then (b) how far does this responsibility go?  To public pronouncements?  To sanctions?  To the nation's border?  To physical intervention?  It seems that if it is true that we should have physically prevented the looting of the museums (which would have required wounding and killing many civilians on the building steps), then we should have sent special forces in to stop the destruction in Afghanistan.  What troubles me in a greater sense is that in all the debate about this situation and its implications, many of us are inspired to draw definite lines of principle without thinking just where those lines stop and start.  For example:  If we invaded Iraq to liberate the oppressed, why aren't we planning for the next operation elsewhere in the world?  There are plenty of targets.  If we should not have invaded Iraq because it was about oil, then would anyone have ever been able to stop daily rape, torture, and terror within its borders?  I hear a lot of absolutes, but not a whole lot of thinking.  We seem to prefer a world in bright, contrasting colors, drawn in broad, clear strokes, rather than the contradictory mess it actually is.  We seem to fight for easy definitions rather than face up to the unruly reality.  I'm beginning to wonder if our world is not in the clutches of conservatives, or liberals, or lobbyists, or lawyers; if it is trapped and pinned not by these, but by something completely different.  I'm beginning to wonder if our world -- if humanity -- has finally been overrun by idealists.         "

But, assuming that we were standing right in front of the museum as looting was going on, how should we have stopped hundreds of people from looting/stealing/destroying these artifacts?  Shoot them?  Beat them with the butts of rifles?  The US Army and Marines are not into crowd control.  They are not permitted to operate in a police capacity in the US (posse comitatus).  They don't carry a lot of tear gas, especially when in a war zone.  Their primary job is to identify the enemy, not looter, and shoot him.

It seems to me that if they don't see a difference between stealing a Sony television from a Baath vacation home and stealing jewelery or pottery of their own heritage and history from 4,000 years ago, then that's really their problem, and they should receive the brunt of the outrage.  The fact that looting was possible -- that is our fault, to some degree, for not planning for a more rapid law enforcement plan (assuming one was even possible).  But *what* they loot -- that seems to me to be merely a reflection of either their own wisdom or ignorance.  I share this thought (which may be changed without notice) because the whole affair has sparked in me an interesting question:  Are the historical treasures of a culture the property and responsibility of that culture, or the world at large?  I'm not talking about interest -- of course they're of great *interest* to the world.  But does that interest translate seamlessly into the realm of property and responsbility?  I'm reminded of the Taliban blasting those awesome Buddhist sculptures.  Would there have been justification for external cultures to use force to protect those works on behalf of the world community?  If not, then why all the anger directed at the world community for not stopping Iraqis from looting their own heritage?  Granted, one can argue that the world community created a situation in which looting could flourish -- but does this argument truly address the issue?  At some point, shouldn't a culture or a people show some restraint and control their more childish, primitive passions?  If they are unable to do so -- is that truly our fault?         "

"
"7672",7672,734562,"Libra","           Here is my opinion on what is going on with the Matrix.  In the first one, the machines created a perfect world, but the human mind would not accept it, so it was a 'monumental failure'.  So, they created a second, less than perfect, world.  As the Architect said 99.9% of the people accepted it.  I think that the machines, not being stupid, decided to create another false world outside of the 20th century world.  This is for those 0.1% of minds that could not accept what they saw.  This new world allows them to think that they are fighting for the freedom of mankind and keeps them from noticing the imperfections in the world because Zion is by no means a perfect world.  In the end they are still just coppertops.  I think Neo is the One that can change the laws of both worlds, not just the 20th century one, which we saw at the end with the sentinels.  That is why he is so powerful in the 20th century one, because to him, it is almost like us playing a kids game.  Doing the math, if the 250,000 people in Zion represent the 0.1%, then that means that the population in the matrix is just under 250 million, or just slightly less than the population of the US.  At 12,000 BTU per body, that is 3 billion BTU, which will run a few lightbulbs.  Now, I have several questions remaining  1)  What is Smith up to? 2)  What happened to the Architect? 3)  Is the Oracle working for the System or freelance? 3a)  If the System, why help Neo? 3b)  If freelance, why? 4)  If the people in Zion are plugged into a Matrix, can they wake up?         "

I liked it fine, but got frustrated with SciFi's handling of it.  Current season this week.  First season next week.  Not on the following week.  For the record, I HATED the way it ended.

While many of the articles/comics in the links you post piss me off to no end, I accept them as reflective of your views and not you trying to tell me how to act or think.  You don't necessarily share our passion (to strong a word but I can't think of a better one) for Buffy.  That is fine.  I don't get most of the song lyrics that are ocassionally posted here and have actually stopped reading them.  I don't complain about them being here, I just don't participate in the discussion about them.  While this group is small, it is diverse.  We all have things we like and don't like, things we will agree on and things we won't.  I like discussing things with other people, as I assume we all do or we wouldn't be posting here.  Please, let's not place restrictions on what we discuss.    I am not angry with you about your post, but it did pluck something.  I think JLS was correct in that if this discussion had been about B5, you would have been involved, but someone else who did not share your passion for it might not.         "

"7734",7734,734562,"Libra","           The only discrepancy in the whole article that troubled me was Bush's insistence that he initially watched it on television, if the evidence shows he did not.  All politicians create a reality for us -- a necessity for all leaders, the fictionalizing of the public self -- and any thinking person can easily see through the smoke.  However, it disturbs me when the smoke is this obvious -- not because it reflects badly on the politician (who is doing what all leaders must do), but because it reveals an alarming assumption of the simple-mindedness of the public.  If the article is factual on this point, I would have preferred if Bush had said he heard about it through an aide, or that it was confusing and no one clearly knew what was going on, than to create a story about watching it on television.  If true, it is a silly and unnecessary lie.  Beyond that one point, the rest of the article kind of rolled over me as a sea of timestamps and vague outrage.  Conspiracy?  No.  Confused and silly humans?  Sure.  Unnecessary fictionalizing?  You bet.         "

"7737",7737,734562,"Libra","           Ben - I read some of the article and skimmed other parts.  It takes a little longer than 15 minutes to read it all.  I cannot believe that the author(s) is harping over 'discrepancies' of 2-3 minutes on some of these events.  If you take a room full of 30 people and ask then waht time it is, I can almost guarantee that you will get answers that vary plus or minus five minutes from each other.  As far as the opening statement that he knew we were under attack at 8:48, I strongly disagree.  It is very easy to sit here a year and half removed from the attacks and state what we know to be true now.  At 8:48, all anyone knew is that 1 aircraft had crashed into WTC.  At least 1, possibly 2, other aircraft were out of radio contact and were not transmitting on their transponders.  It could have been coincidence (a terrible accident and electrical failures on the planes).  I would not be surprised if the message, as it was passed up from ATC to other people (SS and NORAD), that they insisted on confirmation before taking any drastic action.  That obviously changed when the second plane hit.  As for why Cheney was immediately scooted out of the White House and Bush was not out of the school, think for a minute.  If you were flying over DC (which was difficult before 9/11 and impossible now), you would very easily be able to locate the White House, Capitol, monuments, and other known land marks.  I bet that if you were flying over Richmond, a city you know well, you would have a hard time locating specific non-descript buildings like a school.  Now think about a terrorist, with only basic flying abilities and limited knowledge of the target area.  They would have an extremely difficult time locating the school.  Bush was as safe as he could be at the school.  No plane was going to crash into the school.  The White House was a very likely target.  Cheney was in more immediate danger than Bush.  As for the differences in the accounts by various people, does that really need explaining?  Different people, different priorities, different personalities, different memories.  I don't know who or what this group is, but they sound almost as bad as the French author that tried to say we attacked the Pentagon with a missile.  There is no conspiracy here.  The CIA did not kill JFK.  FDR did not have advanced notice of Pearl Harbor.  Aliens did not crash in Roswell (ok, I might not believe that one).  Monica Lewinski was not a plant by the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy.  The US Navy did not shoot down TWA 800.  Did I miss any?         "

"7740",7740,734562,"Libra","           as far as all the potential slayers becoming slayers  at the same time, i don't think that was heavy-handed or took away from the message of personal empowerment. one of the purposes for buffy in the first place was to create a powerful female character who was also human and had human foibles and desires.  buffy was not so much someone beyond us as she was someone who despite all of her powers and responsibilites was so much like us. and, i believe, one of the messages of the series was that we (women), in one way or another,  are all potential slayers - we all have untapped powers that we just need to realize and cultivate.  and as faith herself as shown, just because you are female does not mean you will be 'good' if given the power of a slayer.  faith did turn back to the good side but not before a long, difficult struggle.   now it can be argued that there was no real male empowerment going on - i personally think men have more than enough rolemodels for that already.  and the men in buffy were strong - even spike who sacrificed himself for the love of a woman who he knew would never truly love him back.  such an archetypal theme -- the pain that is borne from unrequited love.   and i agree that the angel part was nice but contrived.  however, the line about her 'cookieness' was worth it.            "
"7741",7741,734562,"Libra","           I enjoyed Buffy's solution, and a few of the exchanges.  Beyond that:  One of the ubervamps nearly killed Buffy; now Andrew, Anya, Wood, Giles, and Xander can take out a few.  Angel arrived to deliver an amulet that did...what, exactly?  Talk about easy fixes.  Good thing Angel set up that second line of defense...where, exactly?  If it was daylight, couldn't they have knocked down the walls so the ubervamps couldn't get out of the hole?  Easy fix, part 2: the scythe.  Please.  Never mentioned before, never fully explained, and looked like a prop for some Klingon blood feud.  And let's introduce Buffy's greatest threat towards the end of the season, with no backstory, no explanation -- she just needs something to hit.  And let's invent a Big Bad that can be any dead person, and *not* have it appear as Tara at any time, or, in the last moment, appear as her mother -- wouldn't *that* have been more morale-defeating?  And throughout the enTIRE series it has been proven that crosses repel vampires, yet not *one* person brings a cross into the *Hellmouth*.  As for Kennedy and Willow, the writers assumed I would care, without making any effort to sell it.  And finally, Spike, who the writers have worked *very* hard to sell to me, sacrifices himself not in a personal, character-driven way, but by wearing an unexplained amulet that robs him of choice -- he never knew what it did, or the consequences, until the last moment, so instead of making a journey from A to B, he suddenly finds himself at B, and figures, what the hell, might as well.  That's not sacrifice, that's circumstance.  I *much* preferred Anya's sudden death in battle.  A senseless death should be a senseless death, not a slapped-together oh-lookout-I-guess-I'm-sacrificing-myself-oh-well death.  Either write a character-driven sacrifice based on clear, high-stakes choice, or let the character simply die in battle.  Meanwhile -- I enjoyed the funny moments, I enjoyed Angel's initial appearance (though he disappeared as yet another casualty in the writer-painted-in-a-corner situation), and I *thoroughly* enjoyed Buffy's solution, though I question the wisdom of ending the series with such a world-changing event -- who is going to teach all these girls?  I predict that, being human, the majority will turn out to be chaotic and dangerous.  But of course, we know they won't, because we all know that if women were given such power, surely they wouldn't do the baaaad things men do, because women are inherently *good* creatures!  Take that, evil evil men!  I am sorely disappointed that the story, which was so effective at creating a metaphor and myth for personal empowerment, ended on such a simplistic, heavy-handed note.  The show remains as important to me as Twin Peaks or B5.  I will enjoy it for many years.  But beyond season 5, it was notable only for select episodes or isolated moments.  To its credit, those select episodes and isolated moments were better than most of the television out there at the time, and that's a high compliment indeed.  Sometime, watch the whole arc of season 3 with the mayor, or season 5 with Glory.  Then watch season 7, and note how it skips and sputters to the end.  It could have been, should have been, so much more.         "

"7755",7755,734562,"Libra","           It's not new.  For example, my Government teacher in high school referred to little-d democrats and big-d democrats, as well as little-r republicans and big-r republicans.  Usually the terms distinguish between the theory and the party.  It has never occurred to me to apply actual rules to their use.  I try to distinguish between upper- and lower-case in both text and conversation when I feel the need.  In general, the common popular usages are almost universally in reference to a party, even when the speaker claims otherwise, so it's not worth inquiring further.  If, in conversation, I claim simply to be a republican, and the listener hears 'party,' that is generally his or her problem, not mine.  One might as well carry around a pre-made disclaimer to be read every time one says 'god.'  More to the point, to most people I have observed, the distinction is insignificant or irrelevant.  I feel most politically-minded people became so because of issues rather than theory.  Theory usually comes later, and is grafted to become inseparable from the issues.  Postscript:  To be fair, the term 'little-d democratic' is far more frequent than 'little-r republican,' because 'democratic' is such a commonly used term to define a method of decision-making.  Because no one thinks much about how this country is arguably a republic, or why it was designed as one, and because of the cultural saturation of our political parties, it's almost pointless to attempt a distinction between republican/Republican in casual company.  Since (R)epublican has such a universally illustrative meaning, why bother with such a minor quibble as capitalization?  And so it goes.         "

"7763",7763,734562,"Libra","           Two cents:  wrong and evil, and for that matter right and good, are not the same thing.  Also:  of the final examples, I feel rape is the stronger of the two.  Murder is a sub-category of ending a life, and requires more clarification to be both relevant and effective.  A minor distinction, but an important one for your larger argument.  As to the issue of suffering needlessly, I am generally curious:  at what point does the suffering become needless?  For that matter, when is suffering needful?  Is suffering validated by the beauty or wisdom that comes from it?  If one person suffers from a disease and draws on that suffering to compose a heartrending symphony and then dies, while another without such talent stares out a dirty window until he or she suffers the same fate, unknown and unheard -- were both experiences equally needless?  What of the many who will be touched by and grow from hearing the symphony?  For that matter, what of the son or daughter of the other individual, who, having watched the loved one die, dedicates him- or herself to raising a stronger and more loved family than might have been possible before?  Does that person's suffering suddenly become needful?  I raise such questions not because I favor generally institutionalized suffering -- surely not -- but I am reluctant to dispense with suffering altogether by labeling it as needless, without understanding where the line is drawn, beyond the usual extreme examples.  I feel that only by defining one's terms can one be assured of success in any discourse.  Once again, my issue is with absolutes.  I am wary of them.  They occur nowhere in the universe except the human imagination, and I have yet personally to see one single absolute that applies in infinite cases at infinite times.         "

"7766",7766,734562,"Libra","           r/R, d/D:  The subject is a bit cumbersome for blog posting.  But I will try, by presenting a series of possibly unfair oversimplifications.  As a republican, I focus on the realistic application of the political philosophy, while ignoring all specific issues.  (R)epublicans (and (D)emocrats) usually unite political philosophy and social engineering.  As I use the terms, to be (r)epublican or (d)emocrat is to place a template, a patterned design, atop an ever-moving and ever-changing society.  (r)s and (d)s don't particularly mind what that constantly-moving society believes or wants or fears, as long the overlaying template is there to best realize its desires.  The overlaying template or design exists not as a restriction, but as the best possible expediter of the society's desires.  For example, I believe ideas best flow up, from local to national.  To enforce this empowers, challenges, educates, and generally lights a fire in the populace.  I don't particularly care what the ideas are, as long as they push upward from the grass.  This is exciting and involving.  A democrat might believe that ideas best flow down, from national to local.  Such a path has the valid benefit of increased speed and less effort.  But for various reasons, I generally reject it despite its strengths.  In general, I perceive (R)epublicans and (D)emocrats as starting from this point, but then grafting onto this foundation a superfluous catalog of issues, agendas, and ideologies.  Also, (R)s and (D)s usually strike me as absolutist, which is not to my taste.  I am not entirely pleased with the words I've chosen or the presentation of my ideas, but I felt it only fair to respond to your inquiry.

"7769",7769,734562,"Libra","           part of the difficulty one faces with bringing such arguments to certain republican mindsets:   *sometimes*, you're dealing with social darwinists, who believe that only the strong will (and should) survive.  as they see it, the species, and society, is only as strong as its weakest link; ergo, if you continue to coddle the poorest and weakest elements of the population, they will only continue to breed more poor and weak persons.  evolution has proven time and again that when a given species fails to act or become as strong or stronger than their competitors, they soon go the route of extinction.  mind you, this is a rather extreme point of view, and i seriously doubt that anyone who subscribed to it would come right out and confirm this (at least, in political circles).  there are plenty of milder versions of this philsophy out there - and more extreme ones.  eugenics was committed to the idea that, ultimately, we should set a standard for the human race in regards to intelligence, strength and attractiveness, and eliminate any member of the population who did not meet the minimum requirements established by this standard - or at least discourage if not prevent those same members from producing offspring.  this sort of thing is done all the time to other species by farmers and their ilk; why not on our own race, some have asked.  involuntary sterilization of institutionalized mentally retarded persons continued in virginia until about the seventies or so, i believe.  it does raise some interesting questions about the short term sacrifice, long term gain strategy that miriam spoke of; if via genetics, we could eliminate all disease, physical and mental disability, etc. from the human race via the systematic use of genetic manipulation prior and during each and every human conception, why shouldn't we, for the betterment of our species?  this assumes that the genetics in question were tried and true, and took into account the need to allow for some diversity in order to prevent the human race from being wiped out in one pass by a new, never before seen disease.  as for education of and for all youth, i'm all for it - but who's in charge of creating the curriculum?  should it be creatively or technically driven?  should it be paid for on a county, state or nationwide basis, or some combination thereof?  should teachers or parents have more control and responsibility for children's behavior?  should we offer the benefits of education only to citizens of our country, or to those of others as well?    as for 'the social contract which dictates that that we provide the best services we can for each member of society because that's just the ethical thing to do', it certainly sounds like a good and benevolent concept; the problem with those social contracts is that nobody has to sign them.    in the end, the policies and procedures of the nation (and the world, to a degree) are decided by rich men in high towers, as it has been for thousands of years.  there is a revolution every now and again, and occasionally the men in question are dragged out and shot; but the towers remain, and eventually, someone takes up residence once again.  without them, there can be no true order; with them, there can be no real freedom.         "
"7770",7770,734562,"Libra","           I was with you until the last sentence.  It seems to me that ethical systems belong in the private sphere, not the public one.  In general, institutions make lousy ethicists.  Further, I feel the weak link of the sentence is the term 'best services.'  It is impossible for more than one human to agree on what that entails in all cases.  Also, the term 'social contract' makes me uncomfortable.  I have signed no such contract.  Finally, for the record, while I appreciate your aesthetic choice to use only lower-case, it can have unfortunate results.  For example, I consider myself a republican -- lower-case -- not a Republican, upper-case.  As with democratic and Democratic, there are subtle, yet important differences between the two.  As for the text preceding that sentence, I hope the tide turns in favor of those with this condition.  If the resources are available, and the public agrees on the necessary trade-offs, perhaps one day it will come to pass.         "
"7771",7771,734562,"Libra","           to bring up a topic that was introduced yesterday during game -  you need to have  good educational system in order to form a peaceful and strong society.  republicans overall don't seem to understand the concept of short term sacrifices for long term goals.  for instance - something close to my own life - autistic children.  there is a program in place which can actually 'cure' up to 60 percent of all children with autism.  the price of this treatment ranges from free in some states (california) to 55,000 dollars per student in others (virginia)  the conservatives in this state go no we can't put more money into special education!  we don't have the budget!  but what they don't realize or seem to realize is that if they invest the money now they can save money on special education for the rest of the students' lives (the treatment generally takes 2-3 years), not have to pay for special services as they get older - this will actually save money in the long run!!!  and also, don't we have a social contract which dictates that we provide the best services we can for each member of society because that's just the ethical thing to do?

"7786",7786,734562,"Libra","           Justice Scalia's (who may be chief justice soon) opinion on the same case: June 27, 2003  |  Today's opinion is the product of a Court, which is the product of a law-profession culture, that has largely signed on to the so-called homosexual agenda, by which I mean the agenda promoted by some homosexual activists directed at eliminating the moral opprobrium that has traditionally attached to homosexual conduct. I noted in an earlier opinion the fact that the American Association of Law Schools (to which any reputable law school must seek to belong) excludes from membership any school that refuses to ban from its job-interview facilities a law firm (no matter how small) that does not wish to hire as a prospective partner a person who openly engages in homosexual conduct.   One of the most revealing statements in today's opinion is the Court's grim warning that the criminalization of homosexual conduct is 'an invitation to subject homosexual persons to discrimination both in the public and in the private spheres.' It is clear from this that the Court has taken sides in the culture war, departing from its role of assuring, as neutral observer, that the democratic rules of engagement are observed. Many Americans do not want persons who openly engage in homosexual conduct as partners in their business, as scoutmasters for their children, as teachers in their children's schools, or as boarders in their home. They view this as protecting themselves and their families from a lifestyle that they believe to be immoral and destructive. The Court views it as 'discrimination' which it is the function of our judgments to deter. So imbued is the Court with the law profession's anti-anti-homosexual culture, that it is seemingly unaware that the attitudes of that culture are not obviously 'mainstream'; that in most States what the Court calls 'discrimination' against those who engage in homosexual acts is perfectly legal; that proposals to ban such 'discrimination' under Title VII have repeatedly been rejected by Congress; that in some cases such 'discrimination' is mandated by federal statute (see 10 U.S.C. 654(b)(1) mandating discharge from the armed forces of any service member who engages in or intends to engage in homosexual acts); and that in some cases such 'discrimination' is a constitutional right.      Let me be clear that I have nothing against homosexuals, or any other group, promoting their agenda through normal democratic means. Social perceptions of sexual and other morality change over time, and every group has the right to persuade its fellow citizens that its view of such matters is the best. That homosexuals have achieved some success in that enterprise is attested to by the fact that Texas is one of the few remaining States that criminalize private, consensual homosexual acts. But persuading one's fellow citizens is one thing, and imposing one's views in absence of democratic majority will is something else. I would no more require a State to criminalize homosexual acts -- or, for that matter, display any moral disapprobation of them -- than I would forbid it to do so. What Texas has chosen to do is well within the range of traditional democratic action, and its hand should not be stayed through the invention of a brand-new 'constitutional right' by a Court that is impatient of democratic change. It is indeed true that 'later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress'; and when that happens, later generations can repeal those laws. But it is the premise of our system that those judgments are to be made by the people, and not imposed by a governing caste that knows best.   One of the benefits of leaving regulation of this matter to the people rather than to the courts is that the people, unlike judges, need not carry things to their logical conclusion. The people may feel that their disapprobation of homosexual conduct is strong enough to disallow homosexual marriage, but not strong enough to criminalize private homosexual acts -- and may legislate accordingly. The Court today pretends that it possesses a similar freedom of action, so that we need not fear judicial imposition of homosexual marriage, as has recently occurred in Canada (in a decision that the Canadian Government has chosen not to appeal). At the end of its opinion -- after having laid waste the foundations of our rational-basis jurisprudence -- the Court says that the present case 'does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter.' Do not believe it. More illuminating than this bald, unreasoned disclaimer is the progression of thought displayed by an earlier passage in the Court's opinion, which notes the constitutional protections afforded to 'personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education,' and then declares that '[p]ersons in a homosexual relationship may seek autonomy for these purposes, just as heterosexual persons do.' (emphasis added). Today's opinion dismantles the structure of constitutional law that has permitted a distinction to be made between heterosexual and homosexual unions, insofar as formal recognition in marriage is concerned. If moral disapprobation of homosexual conduct is 'no legitimate state interest' for purposes of proscribing that conduct; and if, as the Court coos (casting aside all pretense of neutrality), '[w]hen sexuality finds overt expression in intimate conduct with another person, the conduct can be but one element in a personal bond that is more enduring'; what justification could there possibly be for denying the benefits of marriage to homosexual couples exercising '[t]he liberty protected by the Constitution?' Surely not the encouragement of procreation, since the sterile and the elderly are allowed to marry. This case 'does not involve' the issue of homosexual marriage only if one entertains the belief that principle and logic have nothing to do with the decisions of this Court. Many will hope that, as the Court comfortingly assures us, this is so.   The matters appropriate for this Court's resolution are only three: Texas's prohibition of sodomy neither infringes a 'fundamental right' (which the Court does not dispute), nor is unsupported by a rational relation to what the Constitution considers a legitimate state interest, nor denies the equal protection of the laws. I dissent.               "

"7790",7790,734562,"Libra","           Following are excerpts from Justice Kennedy's majority opinion in Lawrence vs. Texas, handed down June 26.  Liberty protects the person from unwarranted government intrusions into a dwelling or other private places. In our tradition the State is not omnipresent in the home. And there are other spheres of our lives and existence, outside the home, where the State should not be a dominant presence. Freedom extends beyond spatial bounds. Liberty presumes an autonomy of self that includes freedom of thought, belief, expression, and certain intimate conduct. The instant case involves liberty of the person both in its spatial and more transcendent dimensions ...  It must be acknowledged, of course, that the Court in Bowers was making the broader point that for centuries there have been powerful voices to condemn homosexual conduct as immoral. The condemnation has been shaped by religious beliefs, conceptions of right and acceptable behavior, and respect for the traditional family. For many persons these are not trivial concerns but profound and deep convictions accepted as ethical and moral principles to which they aspire and which thus determine the course of their lives. These considerations do not answer the question before us, however. The issue is whether the majority may use the power of the State to enforce these views on the whole society through operation of the criminal law. 'Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code.' [Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, (1992)] ...  The present case does not involve minors. It does not involve persons who might be injured or coerced or who are situated in relationships where consent might not easily be refused. It does not involve public conduct or prostitution. It does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter. The case does involve two adults who, with full and mutual consent from each other, engaged in sexual practices common to a homosexual lifestyle. The petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives. The State cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime. Their right to liberty under the Due Process Clause gives them the full right to engage in their conduct without intervention of the government. The Texas statute furthers no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual. Had those who drew and ratified the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment known the components of liberty in its manifold possibilities, they might have been more specific. They did not presume to have this insight. They knew times can blind us to certain truths and later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress. As the Constitution endures, persons in every generation can invoke its principles in their own search for greater freedom.   The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Texas Fourteenth District is reversed.           "
"7791",7791,734562,"Libra","            from  urlLink Penny Arcade :   I decided right away that I wanted to be a bounty hunter, and so with blaster in hand I began working my way up that particular skill tree. This involved a lot of shooting of rats, bugs and crabs.   At one point on Tatooine, I was standing next to a mission terminal waiting for my turn to use it when I saw a large wookie run past me, firing wildly over his shoulder as a tiny crab no bigger than a dinner plate chased him through town. How sad, I thought to myself. I spent countless hours wandering the hillsides in search of new rats and crabs to shoot. Sometimes I would inadvertently stumble upon too large a rat and be forced to high tail it back to town. I placed my character in 'auto run' and pointed him at the nearest town.   As I sat there staring at my Trandoshan bounding across the uneven Tatooine landscape with some kind of super rat closing in on him, I thought to myself, This is not how I want to play in the Star Wars Universe.

Or is oil the only remaining prerequisite for us to provide this service?  Wouldn't it be funny if, upon invading Iraq, we had found no WMD, *and* the country had now run out of oil.  If the *only* reason left was the liberation(?) of the Iraqi people.  I wonder what the pro-war side would say then.  If they would gladly invade other countries, to gain *only* the liberation(?) of the populace.  Personally, I certainly hope WMD are found.

"7932",7932,734562,"Libra","           That's oen of the reasons why I believe in God...'cause I feel like too much happens that seems to be meant for the enlightenment of myself and others.  I know there are many people close to me who, like me, would not be the unique and thoughtful individuals they are today if not for some of the trials they endured and subsequently learned from.    Personally, I have worked toward getting my intellect and emotion on par through lots and lots of therapy.  Therapy really helps me to make the connection between those two facets of myself, and helps me to see the enlightenment I can obtain through my painful experiences, instead of just wallowing in the so-called cosmic injustice.  I could say that all the emotional battery I endured from my peers growing up was unfair, unjust, wrong, and nothing but bruises and scars on my psyche.  But somehow my downward spiral to the bottom of my emotional barrel showed me that I can go up, that if I want to keep living, I have no CHOICE but to go up.  And my intellectual side has made that upward journey a lot easier.  It's wonderful when you start to transform your pain and anger into joy.  It's not always easy, but damn it feels good when you get there.  I may not be able to do it every day, but I'm getting better and better the more I practice.  And it makes appreciating the simple yet immense joys of life and love so much easier and necessary.  I spend a good portion of my day in a state of humility and gratitude for my past pains, becaue I honestly believe that I would not know the joy I know today without them.    And having been to the bottom and back, when you come out on the other side, suddenly your priorities are so much more clear.  Losing everything emotionally helps you so much to realize what's truly important to you, if you allow yourself to reflect on the loss with more of a sense of evaluation and new perspective than in anger and resentment for having had to lose everything in the first place.  I slip sometimes, especially when I'm hormonal, so that's why I continue to go to therapy...because it keeps me in check about what's really important, especially when I start to fret about silly incidental things like my weight and my daily stress at work, things that at first seem overwhelming, but, in the big picture, are nearly meaningless.  The truly important things in my life seem to have a way of working themselves out.    I don't know if I came even remotely close to answering your question, but these are the thoughts that came out of my head when I read your post, so I hope you enjoy them. :)         "

While this is true, he also based his character on one more influence: Pepe Le Pew, the skunk from Looney Tunes. Depp says...   'Yeah, I kind of incorporated the idea of Keith. Not like an imitation of Keith or anything but just that wisdom that he carries, that sort of confidence that he has, that attack that he has. So I got that on one side and on the other side I took a little bit of this cartoon character that I've always loved when I was a kid, his name was Pepe Le Pew. Yeah, the skunk. He smelled horrible, but was absolutely convinced that he was the ultimate ladies' man. You know the guy, he'd fall in love with this cat and the cat quite clearly despised him but Pepe Le Pew sort of read it as, 'Oh, she's just playing hard to get. Oh, she's just shy.' '  Sean Leslie,  Salt Lake City, Utah   A. Now that it's been pointed out, I can see the resemblance. And to think I said he was merely channeling a drunken drag queen.

"7969",7969,734562,"Libra","           Q:  I've noticed an interesting trend over the last few years: You can sometimes tell who the 'bad guys' are in a movie or TV show by what computer they use. For instance, on '24,' all the bad guys used PCs while the good guys all used Macs. The same holds true for 'Austin Powers,' 'Legally Blonde,' etc. Why do you think Apple always gets the plumb roles? I'm of the opinion that Hollywood loves the underdog and has a close relationship with Apple computer, whereas PCs seem controlled by a megalomaniac in Seattle. Are there a lot more Mac zealots like me in Hollywood? Does Apple pour sponsorship money in big-budget studio movies?  Justin Toomey, Athens, Ohio  Ebert:  Since many Windows machines look alike, Apple is one of the few manufacturers that can gain by product placement, which accounts for some of the Macs. It's true that the movie industry and creative types in general prefer the Mac. The novelist Tom Clancy sends e-mails with this signature line: 'Never ask a man what computer he uses. If it's a Mac, he'll tell you. If it's not, why embarrass him?'          "

I saw adds for a couple of shows, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy and Boy Meets Boy, or something like that.

I heard something about the Senate confirming a new head of the EPA last week.  Of course, Bush, in his infinite wisdom, pulled yet another Republican governor to fill the slot.

From darkhorizons:  '...the official site reports that Anakin apparently has a scar in the movie but he does not get it in the film, rather the event happens in one of the books preceeding the film.'  Okay, so now *another* book is canon?  What the hell?  Is this a movie or not?  Is it a movie about people whose further adventures are recorded by unnamed historians, or novels about people who occasionally get filmed by some omniscient documentarian?  If both the movie and the book are essentially the same thing, is the movie a better story because it was the one that got filmed, or rather does the book supply backstory that the movie couldn't manage, and if so, why not?  I understand this is just a marketing ploy, but it raises profound questions about the nature of narrative.  (Please note that I'm focusing on canonical texts that occur in the same world and timeline as a movie, or vice versa, *not* spin-offs of either medium that provide alternate adventures.)         "

"8087",8087,734562,"Libra","           A Citizen's Appeal to a General in a Time of War (at Home)   September 12, 2003      Dear General Wesley Clark,   I've been meaning to write to you for some time. Two days after the Oscars, when I felt very alone and somewhat frightened by the level of hatred toward me for daring to suggest that we were being led into war for 'fictitious reasons,' one person stuck his neck out and came to my defense on national television.    And that person was you.   Aaron Brown had just finished interviewing me by satellite on CNN, and I had made a crack about me being 'the only non-general allowed on CNN all week.' He ended the interview and then turned to you, as you were sitting at the desk with him. He asked you what you thought of this crazy guy, Michael Moore. And, although we were still in Week 1 of the war, you boldly said that my dissent was necessary and welcome, and you pointed out that I was against Bush and his 'policies,' not the kids in the service. I sat in Flint, Mich., with the earpiece still in my ear and I was floored -- a GENERAL standing up for me and, in effect, for all the millions who were opposed to the war but had been bullied into silence.   Since that night, I have spent a lot of time checking you out. And what I've learned about you corresponds to my experience with you back in March. You seem to be a man of integrity. You seem not afraid to speak the truth. I liked your answer when you were asked your position on gun control: 'If you are the type of person who likes assault weapons, there is a place for you -- the United States Army. We have them.'   In addition to being first in your class at West Point, a four-star general from Arkansas, and the former supreme commander of NATO -- enough right there that should give pause to any peace-loving person -- I have discovered that ...   1. You oppose the PATRIOT Act and would fight the expansion of its powers.   2. You are firmly pro-choice.   3. You filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court in support of the University of Michigan's affirmative action case.   4. You would get rid of the Bush tax 'cut' and make the rich pay their fair share.   5. You respect the views of our allies and want to work with them and with the rest of the international community.   6. And you oppose war. You have said that war should always be the 'last resort' and that it is military men such as yourself who are the most for peace because it is YOU and your soldiers who have to do the dying. You find something unsettling about a commander in chief who dons a flight suit and pretends to be Top Gun, a stunt that dishonored those who have died in that flight suit in the service of their country.   General Clark, last night I finally got to meet you in person. I would like to share with others what I said to you privately: You may be the person who can defeat George W. Bush in next year's election.   This is not an endorsement. For me, it's too early for that. I have liked Howard Dean (in spite of his flawed positions in support of some capital punishment, his grade 'A' rating from the NRA, and his opposition to cutting the Pentagon budget). And Dennis Kucinich is so committed to all the right stuff. We need candidates in this race who will say the things that need to be said, to push the pathetically lame Democratic Party into having a backbone -- or get out of the way and let us have a REAL second party on the ballot.   But right now, for the sake and survival of our very country, we need someone who is going to get the job done, period. And that job, no matter whom I speak to across America -- be they leftie Green or conservative Democrat, and even many disgusted Republicans -- EVERYONE is of one mind as to what that job is:   Bush must go.   This is war, General, and it's Bush & Co.'s war on us. It's their war on the middle class, the poor, the environment, their war on women and their war against anyone around the world who doesn't accept total American domination. Yes, it's a war -- and we, the people, need a general to beat back those who have abused our Constitution and our basic sense of decency.   The General vs. the Texas Air National Guard deserter! I want to see that debate, and I know who the winner is going to be.   The other night, when you were on Bill Maher's show, he began by reading to you a quote from Howard Dean where he (Dean) tried to run away from the word 'liberal.' Maher said to you, so, General, do you want to run away from that word? Without missing a beat, you said 'No!' and you reminded everyone that America was founded as a 'liberal democracy.' The audience went wild with applause.   That is what we have needed for a long time on our side -- guts. I am sure there are things you and I don't see eye to eye on, but now is the time for all good people from the far left to the middle of the road to bury the damn hatchet and get together behind someone who is not only good on the issues but can beat George W. Bush. And where I come from in the Midwest, General, I know you are the kind of candidate that the average American will vote for.   Michael Moore likes a general? I never thought I'd write these words. But desperate times call for desperate measures. I want to know more about you. I want your voice heard. I would like to see you in these debates. Then let the chips fall where they may -- and we'll all have a better idea of what to do. If you sit it out, then I think we all know what we are left with.   I am asking everyone I know to send an e-mail to you now to encourage you to run, even if they aren't sure they would vote for you. (Wesley Clark's e-mail address is: info@leadershipforamerica.org.) None of us truly know how we will vote five months from now or a year from now. But we do know that this race needs a jolt -- and Bush needs to know that there is one person he won't be able to Dukakisize.   Take the plunge, General Clark. At the very least, the nation needs to hear what you know about what was really behind this invasion of Iraq and your fresh ideas of how we can live in a more peaceful world. Yes, your country needs you to perform one more act of brave service -- to help defeat an enemy from within, at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, an address that used to belong to 'we, the people.'

Even the king of the jungle knows that readers digest  and writers cramp.   There was a man who entered a local paper's pun  contest.

It is insufferable to claim you 'never' see horror movies (or Westerns, musicals, war movies, teenage romances or slasher pictures). You're presenting ignorance as taste.  The trick is to find the good ones. The French auteur critics did a lot of helpful spadework, resurrecting genres and rehabilitating reputations, but they were not always right -- and besides, you have to feel it for yourself. If a film holds my attention, it is in one way or another a good one. If it moves or delights me, it may be great. If I am distracted by its conventions, obligatory scenes and carelessness or lack of ambition, it deserves to be tossed back into the genre.'          "

"8187",8187,734562,"Libra","           Castillion was rescued during the collapse by unnamed friends, and is now alive and well in the Ethereal.  The party talked with him in the office of Din Dal Kut, who resides on a splinter plane.  It seems that when Thulos took Terranel, the 'local group' of the multiverse was torn away with it, and all exist as a miniature multiverse in the in-between-place.  A side result of this occurence is that, according to Castillion, the dead have nowhere to go, and have been gathering at an unknown city for millenia.  Castillion is now dedicated to renewing contact with the gods, if possible.  He has recommened that the party join forces with the Harpers, a secret society formed by the last Elven bard at the very end of the Great Retreat.  Upon seeing Calleum and the banner of Heironeous in a magical viewing painting/frame on Din Dal Kut's office wall, Burne leapt to join his mentor, and was last seen in a battle in Rashemen, one of the lands that borders the Far East.  The act broke the portal, and the party was unable to follow.  Also, Castillon is Ian's father.  Having reached the end of the original journey, Ian and Gregory are beginning to question if they should continue, or return to Tilverton to tell of Castillion's demise -- which was Castillion's request, as the truth would be too difficult to understand.  Players have the option of sending their character off to do something long-term, and create and play a new character.  The world stage has expanded wide enough to accomodate such.  Once the false murder rap is resolved, the party may see the Breaking of the original Fellowship -- but the beginning of a much larger, world-spanning epic.         "

"8218",8218,734562,"Libra","           Hey John!  It's weird to hear that you didn't think that people in the UK care about US politics.  The article that Ben put up was from the  Independent  and it is one of the most reputable and widespread newpapers here.  That story was on the front page.  People in Europe generally know more about US politics than Americans do, since our decisions seem to greatly affect them.  People here are terrified that George Bush is going to get elected again and when they hear things like that story, they get even more nervous.  They blame Bush for dragging them into a war that they don't want to be in.  The protest against the invasion of Iraq in London last February was the largest public demonstration that has ever occured in England.  Tony Blair completely ignored the consensus of the people, which led to his lovely nickname, 'Bush's Bitch'.  Due to Blair's alliance with the US concerning the occupation of Iraq, the Labour party might lose its power in the up-coming elections.  The Liberal Democrats have already gained alot of seats in Parliment and polls show that they will most likely gain many more.  America is a super power and right now Bush's shitty foreign diplomacy skills have angered people all over the world and caused them to rally against us.  Now the papers are saying that the US is giving Iran a deadline to prove that it doesn't have nuclear weapons.  Sound familiar?  That worked so well last time.  How that hell can you prove that you don't have something?  Any way, the majority of people here are intensely hoping that Bush will get voted out soon.  English media is typically very well researched.  The newspapers here were the first to release reports on the how Bush stole the Florida election.  Okay...just realized that I'm rambling, so I'm going to stop myself there.    On to fun things.  Nick, my boy here, is coming to the US for Christmas!  Yay.  Isn't that exciting?  He might be performing at that new comedy club in Richmond, but his agent is still working that out.

The thermal imaging thing is basically a double check to make sure that there are not more votes recorded on the computer's memory card than were actually cast.  It does it by having heat sensors that detect the heat from your fingers as you touch the screen.  The problem that I don't understand is how do you keep that number from being messed with?  Then again, I am not a computer software exper.  As for Franken, I ignore him just as I do Bill O'Reilly.  Thinking about, the reason they hate each other so much is that they are just alike except for the extreme opposition of their political views.  As for Rush, I am currently in a phase of not listening to him, but it will be interesting to see what happens when he comes back from rehab.

"
"8224",8224,734562,"Libra","           Ben - Honestly I did not read the entire article.  When I started seeing where it was going with the tone of it being a Republican/republican conspiracy AND saw that I was maybe a third of the way through, I did stop reading.  I tried to be clear that I was not attcking Ben Haley directly with my thoughts on the response to the 2000 elections by saying the collective you.  I used your name just to make sure you saw it, since you posted the original article.  I apolgize for the force of my reposne, but it set me off yesterday.  I get a little tired of the 'corporations are evil' and 'corporations have the Republicans in their pockets' attitudes.  Assuming for a moment that the second is true (which I do not agree with since most corporations grease the palms of just about any politician, regardless of party affiliation, to make sure they have access to power brokers),  a corporation is going to do what it can to make sure it stays profitable.  To assist with that, they need to be able to influence politicians.  It is generally easier to influence someone to you point of view if they are already close to it to begin with.  Conservitives tend to favor less taxes and less government than liberals.  This fact automatically puts the corporations more towards the conservatives.  The voting machines/software/hardware have to be made by someone.  The entities that can most easily do it are corporations.  Let's say for a second that a bunch of hackers got together and made some apparently good software.  Should the software be mistrusted because the hackers tend to be less concerned with laws of society?  Not if it works.  Now, the whole restriction on who can review the raw data, uh-uh, that is bogus.  I can see making the non-corporate personnel signing a non-disclosure agreement about whatever they see in the guts of the machine, but the integrity of the system has to come first.  And not using the full capabilities of the software (thermal imaging to keep track of what part of the screen was touched), why bother having it if you are not going to use it.  My main umbrage was the implied tone of the article that Republicans are pulling all these strings behind the scenes and that we are all evil bastards complicit in the grand conspiracy to make sure we are in control.  I initially thought you sneaked a Salon.com article by me.  I was a little shocked to see that someone in the UK would be that interested in our politics.  Again, Ben, I apologize if you thought my response was directly aimed at you.  I can see why you would think that (since I did use your name in my first sentence), but it really was not.  Now, if you will please excuse me while I attend my weekly strategy meeting for keeping the masses under control....             "

Battery life, of course, depends on individual use. Owners of the original generation of iPods are doing fine on the boards.   i just got off the phone with a representative at Apple.  here's the story: up until literally a  week  ago (!), anyone whose internal iPod battery died had to pay (at the very least)  $250.00  to have the unit serviced, regardless of what was wrong with it; which, of course, is almost as much as buying a new one (they run about 3, 4 and 5 hundred dollars each, depending on the GB).  as you might have guessed, consumers weren't too happy with the cost, so Apple finally relented (as i said, just about 7 days ago), and began offering a 'battery exchange program' for those whose iPod batteries died.  the cost of this service is  $99.00, plus shipping and handling .  to have your battery replaced, you are required to  mail your iPod back to the company , and they may send a replacement unit back instead of your original, depending on their workload.  the nationwide Apple stores cannot replace your battery, and according to the company, neither can the owner; the internal battery is  not  being offered for individual sale by Apple.  a second option is to purchase Apple's 'iPod Protection Plan' for  $59.00 .  this will cover battery replacement for up to 2 years, but you must still send the iPod back to Apple for the same aforementioned service.  after the 2 years of the plan are up, you're back to the $99.00 charge for battery replacement.   despite the company's assertions to the contrary, however, there  is  a non-Apple site that you can buy a replacement iPod internal battery from:  urlLink iPodbattery.com , for about $50 apiece.  they even include online instructions on how to install it, for the  urlLink old  and  urlLink new  models.   average life span of the iPod's internal battery, according to Apple:  1 year with heavy use, 2 years with light use.    it's a brilliant marketing scheme; charge the consumer 3 to 5 hundred dollars for your initial product, and then another hundred bucks every 1-2 years after to keep it running.    i gotta admire them for their chutzpah at the very least, especially with the competition undercutting them by about 50 bucks.  perhaps they figure that the average consumer either won't know any better, or will be unwilling to install the battery themselves...?

"8254",8254,734562,"Libra","           I thought Nick's post was clear and well stated.  As for my agreement regarding his take on the protest -- well, yes, I agree it was his take, since it was his protest, not mine, and those were his reasons.  They seemed valid grievances to me.  I don't really have a response to his suggestions, except they sounded like valid options for debate.  And yes, there certainly are many things that can be done now -- that was my point.  I was just wondering what others thought those should be, as most of what I hear in various media amounts to complaints rather than solutions.  As for handing Iraq over to the UN -- sounds to me like a swift Islamic Fundamentalist state in the making.  Which is what it wants to be, anyway.  All choices being equal, an uninformed populace will take the path of least resistance.  Either the UN's bureaucratic incompetence will set up a fast-track to that result, or the US will spend lots of money, resources, time, and lives on delaying it as long as possible.  The choice, in my layman's opinion, seems not in the destination, which appears predetermined to me, but rather in the journey that gets us there.  Note that I do not consider this fate permanent.  It is merely this generation's path of least resistance.  Revolutionary change takes generations to ripen.  Until then, a populace will suffer any inhumanity in exchange for bread on the shelves and trains that run on time.         "

"8257",8257,734562,"Libra","           JLS: in regards to the protests against Bush's visit to England, you said:    'A shame that 200,000 people organized themselves only to express anger.  Such honest effort and energy expended to no end other than brief catharsis.'   Nick responded to your conclusions.  What did you think of his response?  Do you agree with his take on the protest?    OK, on to the 'Bush unwelcome'. I take the point that a Stop the War protest seems a little pointless about a war that's over, but a) it's not like we were protesting the Boer War or something; there's still shooting and air bombardment going on in Iraq; and b) that wasn't the point of the march anyway.   It was from all kind of angles, but all focusing on Bush and the fact that the 200,000+ people there didn't want to be counted amongst a 'silent majority' welcoming him to Britain and, by extension, tacitly approving his various charming exploits, from Iraq through the clamp-down on civil liberties in the US to 'missile defense', the Kyoto protocol, his stance on the ICC (the International Criminal Court, not the online chess site), illegal holding of prisoners, including British citizens, at Guantanamo Bay and the little fact of his having seized power in the world's most powerful country and our most important ally, with a flagrant disregard for democracy.   It was also a protest against Blair's offering up our country as 'the mother of all photo-ops' (not my phrase - comes from the ex-Foreign Secretary) to the incumbent during his re-election year. As the head of the Labour Party, it seems pretty perverse of our Prime Minister to grant such a PR boost to a pretty extreme Republican administration.    You also said:   'I will repeat the question: What should be done *now*?   Nick responded to this as well: he addressed concerns that people have from many countries, including the US, in regards to Bush's policies in Iraq; it is safe to say that any or all of these issues could and should be addressed immediately.  What is your response to this?  Beyond his list, aren't there a great many other things that can be done now, from changing our tactics in Iraq to overhauling our foreign policy in the middle east overall?    'Oh, yeah, and what to do about Iraq?  Immediate moratorium on any contracts to multinational companies based in any of the invading powers, hand over control to the Arab League with a UN Resolution pledging aid to the restoration of democracy, and invaders to end occupation ASAP.  But I'm just speaking off the top of my head.'    Also, your posts regarding different 'what do i do with  this  flag?' scenarios were clever and hilarious; it helped point out the absurdity of the whole notion that you can make it illegal to burn or otherwise destroy a symbol, which by its very definition cannot truly be destroyed anyway.

"8260",8260,734562,"Libra","           My point is not that the Ten Commandments are old, but rather that they were traditionally authored by Yahweh, the god of the Hebrews in the Old Testament, and to refer to them as a starting point in our legal theory is to make inseperable our society's laws and the aforementioned deity.  Such a link would be quite alarming to citizens who do not worship that particular god.  Unlike many other countries, America is not a nation of culture, religion, or kin.  It is a land of immigrants, regardless of who got here first.  Any attempt to establish a connection to a single, unifying religious tradition immediately excludes hundreds, perhaps thousands, of others, and immediately weakens what I consider one of my country's strengths.  The history of human thought is rich and vast, and is more than capable of providing all the justification necessary to hold a society, or a nation, together.  I see no need to choose one artifact from one religion to serve as a back-up for already existing laws.  It is every family's right to display that artifact -- any artifact -- in its own home, or, alternatively, in any private gathering place.  Such an artifact can inspire as much or as little thought or dialogue as the private individual sees fit.  But to place it in a government courthouse suggests, to me, that our laws and the god of the Old Testament are inexorably connected.  And I just can't find a compelling historical, philosophical, or, for that matter, religious reason that it must be so.  Note:  My argument is focusing on the suggested *connection*; I do not feel the judge in question was directly prohibiting the exercise of any particular religion.  Though I doubt he'd mind very much.         "

My non-legal interpretation  It says Congress can't do it.  Somewhere along the way that got put on the states as well (note that I am not proposing that states should be allowed to).  Displaying an item in a public place is not making a law.  Keep in mind that the writer's of the Bill of Rights had fresh memory of English rule where the Anglican Church was the government endorsed religion.  I don't know what, if any, penalties were involved with practicing a different type of Christianity (or judaism or even worse, considering the English history with the Crusades, islam) or being an atheist.  Perhaps Nick could shed some light on it?  The part that always seems to be forgotten is where is says 'or prohibiting the free excercise thereof.'  Going down the path we are heading, churches on major thoroughfares may not be allowed to display their crosses or Christmas nativities because it can be seen from a public street and might be interpreted as the government endorsing a religion by having a road travel right by the church?

Respect for flag No disrespect should be shown to the flag of the United States of America; the flag should not be dipped to any person or thing. Regimental colors, State flags, and organization or institutional flags are to be dipped as a mark of honor.  (a) The flag should never be displayed with the union down, except as a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property.  (b) The flag should never touch anything beneath it, such as the ground, the floor, water, or merchandise.  (c) The flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free.  (d) The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery. It should never be festooned, drawn back, nor up, in folds, but always allowed to fall free. Bunting of blue, white, and red, always arranged with the blue above, the white in the middle, and the red below, should be used for covering a speaker's desk, draping the front of the platform, and for decoration in general.  (e) The flag should never be fastened, displayed, used, or stored in such a manner as to permit it to be easily torn, soiled, or damaged in any way.  (f) The flag should never be used as a covering for a ceiling.  (g) The flag should never have placed upon it, nor on any part of it, nor attached to it any mark, insignia, letter, word, figure, design, picture, or drawing of any nature.  (h) The flag should never be used as a receptacle for receiving, holding, carrying, or delivering anything.  (i) The flag should never be used for advertising purposes in any manner whatsoever. It should not be embroidered on such articles as cushions or handkerchiefs and the like, printed or otherwise impressed on paper napkins or boxes or anything that is designed for temporary use and discard. Advertising signs should not be fastened to a staff or halyard from which the flag is flown.  (j) No part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform. However, a flag patch may be affixed to the uniform of military personnel, firemen, policemen, and members of patriotic organizations. The flag represents a living country and is itself considered a living thing. Therefore, the lapel flag pin being a replica, should be worn on the left lapel near the heart.  (k) The flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning  I do not think the Code has been modified to account for stickers and magnets.  Note that the prefered way is through burning, just not in protest.  I know that many VFW and Foreign Legion Posts hold ceremnonies each year to dispose of flags and that these do involve burning the flag during a somber ceremony.         "

"8271",8271,734562,"Libra","           I liked the idea of that as an offence - maybe that could've been a way out of being burned as a witch.  As a non-American blogger I've been a little reluctant to get involved in some of these discussions, particularly the bits about flags, but since I started it (the subject, not the flag-burning) I suppose I'd better say something.  Firstly, I think that the idea of having a law against flag-burning is completely nuts.  The moment you start according a symbol - any symbol - that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but important step towards totalitarianism.   Symbols are kind of fickle - they don't  a priori  represent anything in themselves; it's what they are perceived as meaning or made to represent that's important.  The flag may represent freedom to you, but that doesn't mean freedom is affected by burning it, any more than terror, torture, coersion and death vanish when it's burned by someone to whom it represents those things.  It follows that you can't just argue against flag-burning by ascribing some meaning to the flag and saying that the flag-burner must dissapprove of this meaning.    ' by doing so [burning the flag], they are saying to me that they do not like the lifestyle the US lets them lead. The lifestyle that allows them to burn the flag without being arrested or shot .'    Couldn't they be saying just about anything about the US?  Maybe they don't like the choice of milkshakes available there.  It's a little unfair to assume that it's the  positive  things they don't like.  And if they're  really  free to do it, why does taking advantage of that freedom in fact imply any protest at all?  By that logic, having gay sex is a protest against a country that grants the freedom to indulge in it.  I'm sure no-one would say, 'by having gay sex, they are saying to me that they do not like the lifestyle the US lets them lead - the lifestyle that allows them to have gay sex without being arrested or shot.' (This might be a bad example to anyone reading in Georgia*) That said, I think there are tactical reasons, as a protestor, to avoid burning flags - be they the Stars'n'Stripes, the Union Jack, the Tricolore or the Star of David - unless you're a citizen of the country that flag represents.  Unless your point really is 'I hate all Americans/British/French/Jews', in any of which cases I'd really rather not be marching alongside you, that's the message you're going to put across to people in that country.   I was pleased to note, on the march against Bush, that almost every banner and speaker was careful to differentiate between GWB and the population he claims to represent.  I would have felt uncomfortable if someone had burned an American flag, because of the indiscriminate message that would put across to people watching in the US (Yeah, like it made the headlines).  I have zero sentimental or political attachment to my country's flag, but I still feel if I see it burned overseas that I probably wouldn't be welcome at that particular party (unless it's one of those 'Hindus For The Abolition of Primary Colors' demonstrations - those guys are alright).  OK, on to the 'Bush unwelcome'.  I take the point that a Stop the War protest seems a little pointless about a war that's over, but a) it's not like we were protesting the Boer War or something; there's still shooting and air bombardment going on in Iraq; and b) that wasn't the point of the march anyway.

"8273",8273,734562,"Libra","           One can only hope that the debunking from AICN towards the bottom of this posting is true.  My apologies in advance for the lengthy copy/paste.  From Dark Horizons:  ******  ...We've heard about Lucas yet again making changes to the original trilogy to update it. Til now most of the rumours have been about adding additional elements like more in regards to Alderaan before its destruction and so on. The gossip reached fever pitch earlier today over the Internet but now it seems the whole fiasco has been defused. Here's the story.  First up the rumours that emerged over at The Digital Bits yesterday:  'These changes include new special effects, revised and updated shots and scenes, and new footage shot with actors Hayden Christensen (Anakin) and Ian McDiarmid (the Emperor) that would flesh out moments with their characters in the original films. For example, an aged and scarred Hayden now appears as Anakin at the end of Return of the Jedi when Luke removes Vader's helmet.   Among the other changes reportedly being made are the restoration of the original 'Han shoots first' moment from Star Wars and a revamped lightsaber fight between Obi-Wan and Vader. What we've heard meshes with what we've been told before, which is that Lucas has always planned to release ultimate, 'Archive' editions of these films that tie in better with the new prequels.   The main question in our minds now is this: will these changes be completed in time to appear on the DVD releases planned for next September, or will we have to wait until after Episode III hits theaters to see them? And if we have to wait, what versions will appear on the DVDs? Time will tell'.  That wasn't the only site with talk of it. TheForce.Net posted an extensive list of all the apparent rumoured changes in order for the original trilogy - 22 for 'A New Hope', 10 for 'Empire' and 14 for 'Jedi'. Amongst musical cue differences and improved lightsaber and spaceship effects there's some big changes here:  'A New Hope' - A new scene which has been shot during the filming of Episode III in which the Emperor dissolves the Senate.  - The bleeding arm on the floor in the Cantina has been replaced with a non-bleeding arm because it's now canon that lightsabers cauterize wounds  - The original Han/Greedo shooting scene has been restored  - When the Death Star destroys Alderaan there's a new scene of Yoda's reaction to the disturbance in the Force that is created by all those deaths and then it cuts to Obi-Wan reacting to it as well  - Temuera Morrison's voice is being recorded for use with all the stormtroopers  - The Obi-Wan/Vader duel has been spruced up. It is much more epic and there is much more movement. A modified version of Duel of the Fates is being considered for the scene  - There's a new scene (shot during Episode III) where Darth Vader goes to Coruscant and lands his ship in the same building Count Dooku does at the end of Attack of the Clones. Except now the building is all fixed up and it is now Palpatine's palace. He meets with Palpatine to ask for forgiveness for his failure and inform him of a new potential who is strong in the Force  'Empire Strikes Back' - Tom-Toms are now CG, the Hoth battle is much more extensive.  - Temuera Morrison's voice is being recorded for the older Boba Fett and all the stormtroopers  - Ian McDiarmid has refilmed scenes as the Emperor. The conversations between Vader and Palpatine is now longer and features a few connections to the prequels  - Yoda's face is now animated in CG allowing more expression of emotions yet his movements remain the same. Also two deleted scenes featuring Yoda instructing Luke have been restored  - A new scene was shot in which the stormtroopers, after they capture Han, Leia and Chewie, bring Vader the box containing C-3PO in pieces. Vader orders the stormtroopers to bring the broken droid to Chewbacca's cell so that he can fix him  'Return of the Jedi' - Jabba, Yoda & the Ewoks are now mostly CG.   - In the battle of Endor there are thousands of Ewoks and they are more vicious than there midgets-in-suits counterparts. More bite the dust now.  - Palpatine's face has gotten a CG lift, the black blotches removed  - Sebastion Shaw who played Anakin when he was unmasked has been replaced with Hayden Christenson in make-up to make him look older. Anakin has much more dialogue. He apologizes for the destruction he caused, he thanks his son for turning him back to the light, he tells his son to rebuild the Jedi and he says he loves him and his sister. Just before he dies he says, 'It is finished...'.  - We see more planets celebrating at the end of the movie. We see an aged Jar Jar, who is now the leader of the Gungans, on Naboo celebrating with the people of Naboo and the Gungans. We see an old Watto, who is now unable to fly, sitting in a hover chair cheering on Tatooine. During these scenes Across the Stars plays transitioning to the victory celebration music at the Ewok tree village.  - Anakin's spirit is now played by Hayden Christenson with make-up to make him look his age. He looks on proudly at his son Luke with the spirit of Padme by his side  The full list can be found here, there's also talk that 'Episode I' will also get a revamp of some sort.

Here's ' Moriarty':  'I'm going to have to call this one out as being total nonsense.

"8275",8275,734562,"Libra","           The Ten Commandments are the product of a 13th century BCE religion and culture, regardless of the message, and to place them on government property suggests that we should accept the deity Yahweh, or Jehovah, as our single, original source of law.  As for what is wrong with telling people not to kill, to respect their parents, etc.: nothing.  But what is curious is the need to enhance the already strong argument with the physical presence of the Ten Commandments, which, if one is to take them as merely wise suggestions rather than the direct prescriptives of Yahweh, have no more weight than what anyone else recommends anyway.  The only way that words gain weight, or importance, beyond their inherent meaning, is in either how they are used, or who uses them.  The Ten Commandments, traditionally, come directly from Yahweh through Moses.  Take away that connection, and they have no more weight than any other wisdom.  Are our society's laws so dodgy that we need to back them up with a direct line to the Creator of the universe?  My goodness, but that's an alarming prospect.         "

"8277",8277,734562,"Libra","           Johnathan - Who said anything about a theocracy?  Would the commandments be better accepted if the one about honor no other God before me (or something to that effect) was not listed?  What is wrong with telling people to not kill one another, respect their parents, don't steal, don't bear false witness against your neighbor, and don't cover your neighbor's possessions?  I seem to recall that most states have laws against taking another's life (except for the State itself with capital punishment).  Of course, if people did not kill others, then the need for capital punishment would be greatly reduced.  Any, the principles expressed in the commandments sound like pretty good fundamentals to live by to me, and totally non-religious in nature if you ignore where they supposedly came from.    Eva - My point with the statues is what point was toppling a statue of Bush supposed to prove?  I really doubt that anyone in the US will be convinced not to vote for Bush because the people in another country don't like him.  Anyone who considers the actions of the protestors in deciding not to vote for Bush will probably have already decided not to based on many other factors.  As for France and Germany, why would they care if you toppled statues or burned their leaders in effigy?  I'm sure 90%+ of their citizens could care less what we in the US think of their leaders.  All I'm saying is that the reverse is true.  (P.S. Thanks for the trivia information on French Fries.  Don't blame me for someone way back thinking that Flemish Fries did not have the same ring.)  If the British don't like the way their PM is buddying up to the US/Bush, then they should do whatever is necessary under the procedures of Parliament to bring down the government.  If the British Parliament is anything like Israel's or Italy's procedurally, then it should not be difficult.  The British protesting our President accomplishes nothing productive.  We are not going to impeach our President because he is unpopular in England.  The last time I checked, we won a war 222 years ago so that we would not have to take orders from them.  Ben - I don't quite understand the difference between how you typed the one sentence (Free speech just does not apply...) compared to what I typed.  To me they say the same thing.  Then again, my degree is in engineering not english.  The point I was trying to make was regardless of the standard that is set for the definition of free speech, it must be applied universally to the socially acceptable topics (Civil rights) and the socially unacceptable topics (white supremacy).  Burning things in peoples yards (i.e. burning a cross in a black family's yard) is not freedom of speech, but a form of intimidation (and probably terrorism under the Patriot Act).  But, a bunch of guys in a farmer's field, with his permission, burning a cross and spouting their hate speech must be accepted as freedom of speech IF we are going to say that burning the flag is.  If a law is passed to make burning the flag illegal, then doing so is no longer a question social acceptability/unacceptability, but strictly legal versus illegal.  If someone, right now, were to burn a flag in front of me, I would not try to have them arrested because he has not violated any law.  What I am saying is that I think that there should be a law against it.  For my part, when I see someone burning a flag in protest, even if I might have been supportive of their cause previously, they have lost my support, and may have even pushed me to be against it depending on what their cause is.  Johnathan - Somewhere back aways, you were asking about other ways of defiling the flag, I think.  When a flag gets old or tattered, there are ceremonies to cover properly destroying the flag.  Under standard flag etiquette, the flag that was on top of the WTC should have been destroyed long ago, but it has now become a different type of symbol all together.         "

It would kind of *look* like the flag, but not really *be* the flag, thus keeping all true flags safe.  One could even market it as the Safe Protest Flag, and sell it at convenience stores.  Or, one could perform a 'Flag Threatening,' in which a protestor holds a flag *close* to an open flame, but does not catch it on fire, thus conveying one's emotion without actual destruction of the object.  Perhaps the apprehension an observer might feel watching such an act would yield the same impact as actual destruction.         "

As I said before, it is extremely ironic that people will chose to burn the symbol of the country that allows them protest peacefully without getting thrown in jail or worse.  '  the irony is interesting, and somewhat intentional, no doubt; but more importantly, the act of burning the flag identifies the protest in question as a serious one, garnering the attention of the public that the protestors are looking for in regards to their cause.  it shows people that they're mad about what our country is doing - so mad, in fact, that they feel like burning their own flag.    ' People will say that burning the flag is an expression of free speech. Hog wash.

Free speech does not just apply to the things that are considered socially acceptable.  '   assuming you meant to type ' Free speech [just] does not apply to the things that are considered socially acceptable ', tell me, then, if this is what you're saying:   that americans who burn the american flag in a show of protest against US policies should be arrested, because it is socially unacceptable for them to do so, considering they're citizens of a country that lets them protest  without  being arrested.    the definition of what is 'socially acceptable' is just a vague as the definition of 'free speech'; more so, in some cases, given the fact that social standards differ from person to person, city to city, culture to culture... even within the US.    i would daresay that infringing on the rights of others in regards to their own individual pursuit of life, liberty and happiness is unacceptable.  that means i shouldn't be allowed to burn anything on your personal property without your express permission, whether it's a flag or a cross.  doing so on public property, though, is another matter entirely.  that means that *any* group, whether it's white supremisists or dirty hippies, has the right to express themselves in whatever way they see fit, provided their actions do not infringe on the rights of others.  this rule means i could be exposed to plenty of activities and ideas i'm not happy with; but if i am certain of my convictions, they will be made all the stronger via the comparision.    furthermore, ridiculous ideas and beliefs tend to get  stronger  if repressed, not weaker. better to let everything out into the light of day; after a day or so, you'll be able to distinguish between the profound and the poop, via the smell, if you take my meaning.

Change occurs over long periods of time, according to the effects of many disparate forces, each acting separately and often without any awareness of the other.  The best anyone can hope for is to be one of those myriad disparate forces.  A human lifetime is too short a span to allow for complete understanding of long-term change.  My fear is for movements that lack proper perspective.  How many of us recall one isolated incident with our parents that redirected our entire lives for the worse, in some way, leaving a permanent scar?  Yet at that moment, the parent perceived that the action was warranted and appropriate.  It seems to me that wisdom begins with perspective.  And perspective is what the current anti-war movement seems to lack.  A shame, really, because the forces they are protesting -- the hawks of the right -- seem to me, to lack perspective themselves.  Us and Them, targeting issues and each other, firing wide, missing the mark, perpetuating the illusion of dialogue, while History does its own thing in the middle of it all, heedless of the sound and fury.

If one shouldn't burn the flag, can one burn a copy of the Constitution?  Or the Declaration of Independence?  Should one not throw a flag away?  How about cutting it?  Or placing it in acid?

I realize it *thinks* it has, and I acknowledge the thrill and glee of joining a movement, however vague its nature -- but I have yet to hear a clear, compelling manifesto.  Which is a shame, because for all the effort it takes to make and topple a statue, it means nothing without a meaningful message.  I'm sold on the fad, but not the thinking.  A question to the Left:  Assuming that you are correct, that the war was misguided (and I am inclined to agree, to a point), what will it take for the 'movement' to move into the present situation?  Protesting a war that has already happened seems rather silly.  What is the goal -- to get a leader elected who will pull everything *out* of Iraq immediately?  Surely it would be clear to a careful observer that the resulting vacuum would be even worse.  Given that -- what is the *present* strategy of the Left?  What should be done with the *current* situation?  A complete pullout?  Half?  What, exactly?  Assuming the war was wrong -- what should be done *now*?

But more mainstream groups, such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), are also targeted by ALEC as a 'threat,' and the bill would back that up with severe action.   For activists, the danger lies in how A4884 defines 'terrorist' organizations, as 'any association, organization, entity, coalition, or combination of two or more persons with the primary or incidental purpose of supporting any politically motivated activity through intimidation, coercion, fear, or other means.' Activist groups fear that lawful dissent, such as demonstrations, letter-writing campaigns, and leafleting, might fall into any one of those categories, particularly the catchall phrase 'other means.' The bill also seeks to prohibit people from gathering photographic or videotaped evidence of illegal or harmful activities, effectively shutting down the camcorders and other tools used by 21st-century protesters. Additionally, the bill calls for the creation of a state-run website where people convicted of 'eco-terrorism or animal-rights terrorism' would be identified with photographs and stigmatized, much as states do with child molesters.

"8336",8336,734562,"Libra","           Oops, good point, Ben - I never said who I was. Hello, everyone, I'm Nick.  My connection is via Eva - she wickedly seduced me one stormy night in Wales and has come to the UK (my homeland) to haunt my every waking hour - and the occasional one when I'm asleep, too.  I'm a stand-up comic by trade (that's what I was doing in Wales. Eva has far less excuse.).  Don't have a website, I'm afraid, but there's a British comedy website called chortle and I'm reviewed/listed  urlLink there .  Just so as not to be completely disregarding recent topics, the situation here in the UK with regards to elections is that you can take time off work to vote - not the whole day, but half a morning or something - and your employer has to let you.  I think that only applies in general elections, though (the big ones where you're voting in a new government [actually it doesn't quite work like that here, but a full explanation would take me too far from the point]).  I don't think it applies for small, local elections - which is a shame, in a way, since those are the ones where your vote counts most and you have more of a chance to really change things. It seems to me that most of our big elections (in both countries) really only afford the public the chance to ratify elite decisions; they keep the population distanced from actual policy formation whilst providing the comforting illusion that our leaders are answerable to us.  On one level they are, of course, since we can vote them out (when we're allowed to every few years) - but really those changes are pretty cosmetic.  I think the limits of the system are shown up in the following hypothesis: Let's say you introduce mandatory voting, so that there's a 95% turnout. The elected government can claim quite a legitimacy with the mandate of a genuine majority of the population. Or it would, if not for the fact that the people are effectively coerced into making the choice. So to avoid this, a 'None of the above' option is introduced. So far, so democratic.  Now, here's the dilemma: What happens if a majority of the voting population goes with the 'None of the above' choice?  Nobody running for power can legitimately take office, since the people have expressed definitely that they don't want the candidates, but you can't just leave the government empty.  What do you do? As far as I can see the system fails at this point. The powers that be can't really allow the electorate a full and comprehensive democratic choice, since there's the risk that people might use it, and that's not really what the electoral system is for.  Of course, there's already the option of not voting, or spoiling your vote, but that's fine provided those choices don't HAVE to be interpreted as 'None of the above'.  And to be honest, often a more realistic interpretation of not voting might be, 'Mmmmm... My bed's comfy.' Oops. A bit of a rant. Did Eva warn you about my tendency to do that?  To recap: 1. Hello, everybody, nice to meet you. and 2. I read too much Chomsky.         "

What's the lowdown? --Jerry M., Los Angeles    urlLink Dear Jerry:   History records no observation of Christmas before 354, and by that time there was no one around who remembered exactly when Jesus was born. Today, historians have all but given up trying to figure it out. They give his birth date as 6-8 BC (good trick, but this was no ordinary dude) and leave it at that.  Nobody knows exactly why Christ's birthday is celebrated on December 25. One theory holds that this is the right date, postulating that Zachary was high priest and that the Day of Atonement fell on September 24, ergo, John the Baptist was born on June 24 and Christ dropped in exactly six months later on December 25. Modern scholars use this theory to get laughs at cocktail parties.   Another guess works backward from the supposed date of the crucifixion (March 25), figuring that Christ was conceived exactly 33 years before he died, True Believers having no use for fractional numbers. According to the most tenable hypothesis, Christ's birthday was assigned to the winter solstice (December 25 in the Julian calendar, January 6 in the Egyptian) because the date had a ready-made pagan holiday, the 'Birthday of the Invincible Sun' (or 'ancient Saturnalia debauch,' as you put it).  The idea that Jesus was a Pisces probably comes from the characterization of that sign as one of spiritualism, humility, compassion, sacrifice, etc. Students of astrology will tell you it's not kosher to work the formula backwards that way.

"8369",8369,734562,"Libra","           WHITE HOUSE COVERS TRACKS BY REMOVING INFORMATION  In a high-tech cover-up, the Washington Post this morning reports the White House is actively scrubbing government websites clean of any of its own previous statements that have now proven to be untrue. Specifically, on April 23, 2003, the president sent his top international aid official on national television to reassure the public that the cost of war and reconstruction in Iraq would be modest. USAID Director Andrew Natsios, echoing other Administration officials, told Nightline that, 'In terms of the American taxpayers contribution, [$1.7 billion] is it for the US. The American part of this will be $1.7 billion. We have no plans for any further-on funding for this.'  The president has requested more than $166 billion in funding for the war and reconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan this year. But instead of admitting that he misled the nation about the cost of war, the president has allowed the State Department 'to purge the comments by Natsios from the State department's Web site. The transcript, and links to it, have vanished.' (The link where the transcript existed until it caused embarrassment was  urlLink www.usaid.gov/iraq/nightline ).  When confronted with the dishonest whitewash, the administration decided to lie. A Bush spokesman said the administration was forced to remove the statements because, 'there was going to be a cost' charged by ABC for keeping the transcript on the government's site. But as the Post notes, 'other government Web sites, including the State and Defense departments, routinely post interview transcripts, even from 'Nightline,'' and according to ABC News, 'there is no cost.'  This story is not the first time the President has tried to hide critical information from the American public. For instance, the president opposed the creation of the independent 9/11 investigative commission, and has refused to provide the commission with critical information, even under threat of subpoena. Similarly, after making substantial budget cuts, the president ordered the government to stop publishing its regular report detailing those cuts to states. And when confronted with a continuing unemployment crisis, the president ordered the Department of Labor to stop publishing its regular mass layoff report.  It is also not the first time the administration has sought to revise history and public records when those records become incriminating. As the Post reports 'After the insurrection in Iraq proved more stubborn than expected, the White House edited the original headline on its Web site of President Bush's May 1 speech, 'President Bush Announces Combat Operations in Iraq Have Ended,' to insert the word 'Major' before combat.' And the 'Justice Department recently redacted criticism of the department in a consultant's report that had been posted on its Web site.'  Read the  urlLink Mis-Lead .         "

' What's the difference? ' he said. 'If he were to acquire weapons, he would be the danger. That's what I'm trying to explain to you. A gathering threat, after 9-11, is a threat that needed to be dealt with.'    ...i guess the difference that immediately comes to mind would be the one between 1) telling the truth  and 2) lying.    what the fuck, bush?  is  that  the administration's answer to why we haven't found any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq?  that you figured we'd understand that when you  urlLink said  right before the war, 'The dictator of Iraq and his weapons of mass destruction are a threat to the security of free nations',  what you *meant* was, 'The dictator of Iraq is  planning  on producing weapons of mass destruction at some point in future, which  at that time  will be a threat to the security of free nations?'  added bonus: he managed to drop a 9-11 reference into a discussion about the justification for invading Iraq.    dammit to hell; enough of this.  i never expected to agree with the bush administration's policies, but the very least they could do is be straightforward with the people who pay their salaries.

Really, how much skill does it take to talk out of both sides of your mouth like most politicians do?  To quote James Carville (Clinton's attack dog), 'It's the economy, stupid.'  If people are feeling confident in their wallets, the incumbent generally has no problems.  Ben - So we should not have tracked him down, left the country, and let him resume control?  Reports on the news are that most of the attacks are being carried out by Hussein loyalists, Al Queda, or jihadists, not the normal citizens who were brutalized by Hussein.  I have not seen any smug comments for the Republicans, only satisfaction from the military commanders.  That's not to say there won't be, but I have not seen any yet.  As far as WMD, at this point I don't think anyone thinks they will be found.  We can debate from here to eternity about whether or not they ever existed, whether they were smuggled out of the country before the invasion, and whether we were intentionally misled by the President, or if he was misinformed by the intelligence aparatus.  We don't know and probably never will know the certain truth.  You'll believe what you want and I'll believe what I want.           "

"8402",8402,734562,"Libra","           Eva - Perhaps you could explain to me why a single cent of the $20 billion dollars the  US is paying  for reconstruction should go to any country that opposed the _____ (insert your preferred term for the action taken).  If France, Germany, or Russia wish to pony up their own money to reconstruct things and get their contractor's to do so, then let them.  But, as I understand the basis of their arguements, they are upset that we won't let their contractor's bid on projects being paid for with US (and maybe UK?) money.  Mir - Some?  Yes.  Enough to do the job in the near future?  Doubtful.  In my dealing with Contractor's, I have found most of them to be so tight that they squeak and that they claim not to have two pennies to rub together.  So, odds are, except for management and certain ultraskilled positions, they will probably hire Iraqi's to do alot of the work as a cost savings method.  If you bring over your American crews, you need to pay much more (travel and housing) versus using someone local.  I hope and think that most contractor's will do that (see, greed is not always bad)  As far as the medical question goes, your conservative comment seems to imply that you think only conservatives are rich and powerful.  I recall a survey, several years old now, that was looking at the net worth of U.S. Senators.  You might be surprised to learn that there were more Democratic millionaires than Republican.  I honestly don't remember if was a 45 to 40 thing or a 10 to 5, but that is not my point.  There are quite a few rich powerful liberals that aren't champoining these causes either.  Also, do you think that no research is being done on either of the two diseases you specifically mentioned?  Angie can correct me here if I am wrong, but I think that fibro was only recently (last 3-5 years) actually classified as a disease.  I don't think you can expect too much research on a disease most doctors don't know even exists.  I would expect that research is underway now.  As for autisim, I know that research is being done.  There has been some recent finding that some medium used to prepare or administer childhood vaccinations has a mercury compound in it.  There appears to be some connection between the that and autism.  It must be a recent finding, because in 2000, nothing was said about this to us when Katherine got her immunizations, but everytime we get a shot for the twins, it is included in the information given to us.  It does make me ask the question, what is worse - losing your child to mumps, rubella, or polio or having them permanenetly disabled by the prevention?  That's not a choice I really want to make.  Keep in mind that there is only one pot of money for medical research, currently provided by both the public and private sector.  That money has to be divided up amongst AIDS, cancer, MS, heart disease, paralysis and a myriad of other diseases/conditions that I did not mention.  I have much more faith in the private sector to get the most out of this finite pot of money than I do the government.  I have worked for the government and currently work with government programs.  The bureaucratic BS and innefficiencies are maddening.  Money is held up because a form was not filled out 100% correctly or because some Congressman has not had his chance to make a press release about getting the money for his district.  At least with the private sector, they want to get breakthroughs so they can get the return on their investment.  It really is sad that someone is going to benefit from someone else's suffering, but I can't think of a better motivator, since there are very few people in this world who are solely devoted to the relief of suffering (like Mother Teresa was).

"8409",8409,734562,"Libra","           Johnathan - I agree with the similarities between 2004 and 1996 with regards to the motivations of the political parties.  One difference I see is what happened in the 1994 and 2002 mid-tem elections.  Historically, the party out of power gains seats in Congress in the mid-terms.  In 1994, that paragon of virtue (tic) Newt Gingrich managed to energize the Republicans on a national level to take back the House for the first time in 40 or so years.  He then of course proceeded to blow his momentum and hand Clinton the White House in 1996 through a number of missteps.  Fast forward to 2002, and Gephardt (sp?) was banking on retaking control of the House and firming control of the Senate.  Instead, the House remainined in Republican control and the Senate went back to the Republicans.  What does that mean for the upcoming election?  Probably not a damn thing, but it is a difference.  I do have to laugh at the Democrats first harping on the fact the Iraq was going to be a military disaster, which it was not.  Then they latched on to the economy being terrible, but now it is recovering very nicely.  So now they are back to Iraq and the post 'war' efforts and saying we need to get things under control.  But, I am not hearing many solutions, just pointing out the problems, which I fully agree are there.  Angie - Thanks, that makes me much less afraid of Dean.  I did not know he is a doctor.  I have not heard any of Dean's details on the medical front and will not pay attention to them unless and until he becomes the actual nominee.  But, one concern I have of government mandates on things like insurance and medicine, is that it smacks of socialism.  Canada has socialized medicine.  Everyone is covered and the quality of care is good from what I have witnessed.  The problem is with availability of some forms of treatment.  My mother, who handles the insurance for her doctor's office and has many chronic ailments (lupus, arthritis), told me the waiting list for heart catheterization is about 18 months in Canada.  The problem is, when someone needs that procedure, they need it pretty much imediately.  Most people don't survive 18 months, so they travel to the US and pony up the cash to have it done here.  I guess my point is, for right or wrong, profit is what drives most things in this country.  The insurance companies and doctors have to be able to profit from their work or they will do something else, creating a shortage.  I will be curious to see how he addressed this in Vermont.  If the government steps in much further, I am afraid that our medical system will be hurt severly.  Case in point of the profit driven results is Viagra.  I'm sure that there were many other diseases/conditions that Pfizer could have researched besides male impotence.  But, look at the original target 'audience' - Middle Aged White Males.  They knew that they would be able to make a proverbial killing from the general affluence of that market.  In the meantime, research into chronic illnesses go underfunded or totally unresearched.  Mir - I would hope that we will utilize Iraqis as much as possible.  However, given the magnitude of the problems that need to be addressed, I doubt that they have the numbers and/or specialties necessary to do it all.  If we are talking road and bridge work, I would assume that the Iraqis have the ability to do those.  But, if we are talking about updating the electrical system nationwide, they probably don't.  Heck, given what happened here over the summer, you could say that neither the US or Canada do either.         "
"8410",8410,734562,"Libra","           i think that most of the work to build up iraq should be given to iraqi companies or/and as many iraqis as possible should be employed for these projects.         "
"8411",8411,734562,"Libra","           Answer from Ever-so-slightly-left-of-the-middle:  Though Dean's stance is to be as anti-Bush as possible, if you actually listen to him in his speeches and campaigning, he's really not that leftist.  He is about Bush (but not necessarily Iraq), and he is about health care (because he's a doctor).  But in terms of gun control, abortion, the environment, blah blah blah, he's really no more left that the other candidates, if not leaning a little more towards moderate in such areas.  And I think he's a fiscal conservative as well.  He just likes to talk Bush-smack to get people all fired up, even if some of their non-foreign policy political ideologies are not so deeply divided.  That's just what I gleaned from watching him the few times that I have...I just like him because of his health care reform.  Being that I'm a non-senior-citizen with a disability, there aren't a lot of options for people like me, and I like his ideas on how to fix that.  *shrugs*  Bush-smack sounds...dirty.  Sorry.         "
"8412",8412,734562,"Libra","           Answer from the Middle:  Dean's status in the polls is founded entirely on an anti-Bush movement.  Ironically, the Left's motivation for this election -- we hate Bush, we gotta get rid of this man -- is very reminiscent of the Right's motivation in the Clinton era.  Both sides -- the Right, then, and the Left, now -- lacked, and lack, a vision, a plan, a drive to execution.  At 9/11, the Right reacted quickly with a vision and a plan, while the Left sputtered and blew the moment.  Now the Left can only play catch-up, and the only thesis on the table is getting rid of Bush.  The Left needs a vision, a plan, and a reliable leader to initiate the march -- one who won't throw it all away on a cigar and a beret.  Until that happens, they will flail about in vague, yet honest, frustration and anger.  For now, the Right has the money and the product:  Fear sells, and everybody's buying.         "

If so, I am terrified to think that Dean might win the White House, as I have always considered Gore to be a fringe left wing loonie.  If Dean truly is left of Gore....  On a funny note, Dean is aparently raising most of his money via the internet.  If that is the case, he owes Al Gore two thank yous.  First for the endorsement.

"8415",8415,734562,"Libra","           Well, since I am the only one on the right remaining on the blog, I'll give you my opinion.  As with most things, if you want to get a good idea of an entities reasoning for taking an action, follow the money.  I saw many pieces of infomration back in January and February listing the reasons behind France's, Germany's, and to a lesser extent Russia's opposition to the then proposed military actions against Iraq.  They were the top three countries in oil exploration and refining in Iraq, violating many of the UN sanctions against Iraq.  They knew that any change in the government of Iraq would likely cost them those lucrative contracts, rights, and infrastructure.  So they opposed it.  I'll try to locate the information I saw back then and post it here.  Now they are complaining that we won't let them benefit again on the backs of the Iraqi's.  Additionally, I would bet, but don't know for sure, that the money for this work is coming from the US and maybe the UK.  Why would either country want to give this money to someone else who opposed the action to begin with?  Childish?  Most definitely, but it is reality.  Now, if you can show me some work that a) will not be done in a timely fashion because there are not enough companies to do the work or b) only a company from one of those countries is qualified to do, I will have a problem with it.  Otherwise, you reap what you sow.  As an add on to b), the only thing that I comes to mind right off hand is nuclear material clean up.  France would be good at this since they provide a large percentage of their power through nuclear power, and are pretty good at dealing with the waste.  But, since Iraq does not have a nuclear program, I guess that rules that possibility out.         "

Three possibilities:  (1) this is an illustrative image by the filmmakers, to show that the previous anomalies were variations of a single effect, though of course they could not be the same physical body -- which means the monitors are there for either the audience's benefit or Neo's:  ours, in that we need to have this concept presented graphically, or Neo's, in that the Architect is artificially recreating Neo's face to show what the previous anomalies have done, though they would have to have been historically different, unique physical individuals; (2) all anomalies, for some reason, assume within the matrix the physical appearance of what would be the 6th anomaly, i.e., simplisticly, the appearance of Keanu Reeves; or (3) the body of the single individual who represents the anomaly -- to simplify again, Keanu Reeves -- continues to be liberated from and reinserted into the matrix; thus, what we witness at the end could be what has happened five times before:  the physical body returns to the Source, possibly to be placed once again into a stasis pod.  Which means that Neo -- again, the physical body of Keanu Reeves -- has now experienced *six* violent liberations from his physical stasis pod.  In this way, the cycle repeats not only within the Matrix, but in the physical world, as well.         "
"8424",8424,734562,"Libra","            The Architect  - Hello, Neo.   Neo  - Who are you?   The Architect  - I am the Architect. I created the matrix. I've been waiting for you. You have many questions, and although the process has altered your consciousness, you remain irrevocably human. Ergo, some of my answers you will understand, and some of them you will not. Concordantly, while your first question may be the most pertinent, you may or may not realize it is also irrelevant.   Neo  - Why am I here?   The Architect  - Your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation inherent to the programming of the matrix. You are the eventuality of an anomaly, which despite my sincerest efforts I have been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise a harmony of mathematical precision. While it remains a burden to sedulously avoid it, it is not unexpected, and thus not beyond a measure of control. Which has led you, inexorably, here.   Neo  - You haven't answered my question.   The Architect  - Quite right. Interesting. That was quicker than the others.  *The responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors*  Others?  What others?  How many?  Answer me!'    The Architect  - The matrix is older than you know. I prefer counting from the emergence of one integral anomaly to the emergence of the next, in which case this is the sixth version.  *Again, the responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors*   Five versions?   Three?   I've been lied too.   This is bullshit!    Neo : There are only two possible explanations: either no one told me, or no one knows.   The Architect  - Precisely. As you are undoubtedly gathering, the anomaly is systemic, creating fluctuations in even the most simplistic equations.  *Once again, the responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors*   You can't control me! Fuck you!  I'm going to kill you!  You can't make me do anything!    Neo  - Choice. The problem is choice.  * The scene cuts to Trinity fighting an agent, and then back to the Architect's room *   The Architect  - The first matrix I designed was quite naturally perfect. It was a work of art, flawless, sublime.  A triumph equaled only by its monumental failure. The inevitability of its doom is as apparent to me now as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human being. Thus, I redesigned it based on your history to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature.   However, I was again frustrated by failure. I have since come to understand that the answer eluded me because it required a lesser mind, or perhaps a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection. Thus, the answer was stumbled upon by another, an intuitive program, initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche. If I am the father of the matrix, she would undoubtedly be its mother.   Neo  - The Oracle.   The Architect  - Please. As I was saying, she stumbled upon a solution whereby nearly 99.9% of all test subjects accepted the program, as long as they were given a choice, even if they were only aware of the choice at a near unconscious level. While this answer functioned, it was obviously fundamentally flawed, thus creating the otherwise contradictory systemic anomaly, that if left unchecked might threaten the system itself. Ergo, those that refused the program, while a minority, if unchecked would constitute an escalating probability of disaster.   Neo  - This is about Zion.   The Architect  - You are here because Zion is about to be destroyed. Its every living inhabitant terminated, its entire existence eradicated.   Neo  - Bullshit.  *The responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors*   Bullshit!    The Architect  - Denial is the most predictable of all human responses. But, rest assured, this will be the sixth time we have destroyed it, and we have become exceedingly efficient at it.  * Scene cuts to Trinity fighting an agent, and then back to the Architect's room. *   The Architect  - The function of the One is now to return to the source, allowing a temporary dissemination of the code you carry, reinserting the prime program. After which you will be required to select from the matrix 23 individuals: 16 female, 7 male, to rebuild Zion. Failure to comply with this process will result in a cataclysmic system crash killing everyone connected to the matrix, which coupled with the extermination of Zion will ultimately result in the extinction of the entire human race.   Neo  - You won't let it happen, you can't. You need human beings to survive.   The Architect  - There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept. However, the relevant issue is whether or not you are ready to accept the responsibility for the death of every human being in this world.  *The Architect presses a button on a pen that he is holding, and images of people from all over the matrix appear on the monitors*   The Architect  - It is interesting reading your reactions. Your five predecessors were by design based on a similar predication, a contingent affirmation that was meant to create a profound attachment to the rest of your species, facilitating the function of the one. While the others experienced this in a very general way, your experience is far more specific. Vis-a-vis, love.  *Images of Trinity fighting the agent from Neo's dream appear on the monitors*   Neo  - Trinity.   The Architect  - Apropos, she entered the matrix to save your life at the cost of her own.   Neo  - No!   The Architect  - Which brings us at last to the moment of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw is ultimately expressed, and the anomaly revealed as both beginning, and end. There are two doors. The door to your right leads to the source, and the salvation of Zion. The door to the left leads back to the matrix, to her, and to the end of your species. As you adequately put, the problem is choice.   But we already know what you're going to do, don't we? Already I can see the chain reaction, the chemical precursors that signal the onset of emotion, designed specifically to overwhelm logic, and reason. An emotion that is already blinding you from the simple, and obvious truth: she is going to die, and there is nothing that you can do to stop it.  *Neo walks to the door on his left*   The Architect  - Hmph. Hope. It is the quintessential human delusion, simultaneously the source of your greatest strength, and your greatest weakness.   Neo  - If I were you, I would hope that we don't meet again.   The Architect  - We won't.          "
"8425",8425,734562,"Libra","           Two cents:  I think the machines kept Neo alive for fear that if he died, another One would appear and the cycle would repeat.  Same with why they chose not to destroy Zion -- because inevitably the cycle would repeat, and they'd have to do it again.  The Oracle allowed Smith to absorb her so that she could help Neo when he confronted Smith in the final battle; she was left behind when Smith was destroyed.  Speaking for yelahneb:  Ben's theory is that Neo has been altered with cyborg-like implants that allow him to connect with the machines.  I'm not satisfied with this interpretation, but I haven't come up with anything more satisfying myself.  In general, it seemed to me that the goal was not victory/defeat (1 or 0), but the breaking of a cycle: something that was neither 1 nor 0.         "

"8445",8445,734562,"Libra","           If you move past the debate of whether or not the project is needed or if the benefits out weigh the costs/impacts, then we design the projects with human safety as the number one criteria.  The FAA has specific requirements for the grades (steepness) of runways, taxiways and the areas surrounding them to provide a safe operational environment.  Local, state, and Federal requirements then dictate that the designs be accomplished with the smallest amount of impcat to waters of the US, wetlands, and forests (especially in Maryland - the tree is as holy as cows are in India).  It all ends up being a balancing act of safe environment, limited environmental impacts, and minimizing costs (which are 95% funded by the FAA).  In the end, the owner usually does not have too much input on the specifics of how something is done, after all that is what they are paying me for.  They just want their new runway (in this case) and leave the details to us.  To answewr your question, we go to the middle ground as much as possible, if for no other reason than it is legally required.  If I did not have these restrictions, my job would be much easier, but also way more boring.    It is kind of funny because in WWII there were alot of airfield constructed.  In Virginia alone Norfolk, Richmond, Newport News, Roanoke, Suffolk, Franklin, West Point, Emporia, Petersburg, Accomack, and Danville were all constructed in the early 1940's.  For the most part these were built by the Army on swamp land.  Today, they would never be built, because of all the wetland (swamp) impacts.  The group that oversees wetlands?  The US Army Corps of Engineers.  How's that for irony?         "

At least sites/organizations like Salon and Rush Limbaugh are honest about their view of things.   urlLink The press' representation of the public hearing I presented at on Monday   Now, there is nothing untrue in the article.  But, it leaves the impression that there was only dissent.  There were 5 speakers - 1 (Mr. Wilmont) expressed environmental concerns, 1 (Mr. McHaffey) expressed concerns about property value and noise, the other 3 were speaking in favor of the project.  Mr. Wilmont's comments were well expressed and received (unlike some public hearings I have attended where people were ranting and raving), and his comments are acurately and fully presented in the article.  Mr. McHaffey was more concerned with the rezoning of his property from residential to industrial in the past couple of years.  He has consistently (for the last 6 years anyway) complained about helicopter noise.  The proposed development will neither add to nor subtract from the helipcopter operations.  Again, while nothing printed is untrue of what he said, the emphasis of his comments is misrepresented.  Given the title of the article, you would think that nothing positive was said on the hearing.  There were 3 people speaking in favor of the project, and 4 of the 5 Commissioner's (same as Supervisors in Virginia) had positive comments and expectations resulting from the proposed expansion.  The last Commissioner did not comment.  My point is this.  If the press can misrepresent something relatively simple with a negative tilt, how much do they get wrong on issues where people don't know the details?  Reporters are supposed to report the facts and leave the opinions for the editorial page.  Not presenting the whole truth, in my opinion, is the same as stating your own opinions in a news story.           "

It was my first time doing a gig to an audience who predominantly spoke English only as a second or third language.  Very interesting.  They were fine with most of the references (Bush, Iraq, Tony Blair, Harry Potter) and highly amused that my surname means 'poo' in the country of my betrothed.  The Bosnia/Croatia war was a no-go area, since Britain and France opposed Croatia's independence (I knew John Major would one day try to ruin a gig for me) and I think they were a little taken aback by my take on Catholicism, but it was a great night and felt really historic.  This is Croatia's first attempt at starting stand-up comedy and it was only their second show.  It's weird - I've never been shown actually doing my act on TV in Britain but in Croatia it took exactly one night.  Today I walked around Zagreb for about 3 hours.  It's a really beautiful city and has pretty much recovered from the war, cosmetically at least (socially, they have that World Bank/IMF thing going on: 5 per cent of the population is filthy rich and 40 per cent are below the poverty line).  Anyway, I've enjoyed being here immensely and thought I'd share.

"8476",8476,734562,"Libra","           Gusev Crater, Tarus 23, XXVI (MPI) -- A spokesthing for Mars Air Force denounced as false rumors that an alien space craft crashed in the desert, outside of Ares Vallis on Saturday.   Appearing at a press conference today, General Rgrmrmy The Lesser stated that 'the object was, in fact, a harmless high-altitude weather balloon, not an alien spacecraft'.   The story broke late Saturday night when a major stationed at nearby Ares Vallis Air Force Base contacted the Gusev Crater Daily Record with a story about a strange, balloon-shaped object which allegedly came down in the nearby desert, 'bouncing' several times before coming to a stop, and 'deflating in a sudden explosion of alien gases.'   Minutes later, General Rgrmrmy contacted the Daily Record telepathically to contradict the earlier report. General Rgrmrmy stated that hysterical stories of a detachable vehicle roaming across the Martian desert were blatant fiction, provoked by incidences involving swamp gas. But the general public has been slow to accept the Air Force's explanation of recent events, preferring to speculate on the 'other-worldly' nature of the crash debris. Conspiracy theorists have condemned Rgrmrmy's statements as evidence of 'an obvious government cover-up,' pointing out that Mars no longer has any swamps.   They point to the release of secret government memos detailing attempts to discredit reports of the landings by alien space craft.   Local residents, like Driv Rhodo, who lives in the area of the alleged landings, are even more skeptical. 'I seen it with my own 5 eyes' claimed Rhodo last week. 'I've lived here over 300 years, most of my adult life-form. Them things used to be few and far between but lately they come in every few years or so. The government wants to bury the truth but I can tell you what's real. The Earthlings are going to invade and the government is spending our hard earned tax dollars on press releases and denials instead of preparing for the battle to come.'   A spokesthing denied any government involvement in the disappearance of Rhodo, who has not been seen since shortly after the interview, claiming 'Any sentient being knows that a planet with the concentrations of water and oxygen found on Earth is a deadly and inhospitable environment for the formation of life, much less intelligent life. The fear and consternation caused by the unfounded and wild speculations of citizens like Rhodo are a traitorous disservice to the citizens of Mars.'           "
"8477",8477,734562,"Libra","           I listened to about 15 minutes of the State of the Union last night while driving home (which means I heard about 1 minute of speaking and 14 minutes of Republicans standing and clapping).  Forgetting the topic of the exchange for a minute, I did hear a funny thing.  Bush was talking about the expiration of the 'let's get all the dirt we can on everyone and imprison people without due process' act.  He paused for some reason, probably dramatic effect.  At which point there was a smattering of applause from who I assume were Democrats.  Then he continued and said that the terrorist threat would not expire on the same deadline, which of course got a tremendous round of applause.  I saw a replay of that portion of the tape this morning.  He definitely enjoyed that little 'gotcha' moment.  And, like I said, ignoring the topic it surrounded for a moment, it was kind of funny.  Other than that, as much as I like politics, I can't stand the State of Union address.  It never really amounts to more than a chance for politicians to put on a public show of what they are for and against.  The party in power will say that it was a great speech.  The party out of power will say it failed to discuss the really important issues.  Instead, we watched a rerun of Early Edition on PAX.         "

Since the breast reduction, I put weight on different areas of my body than I did before.  Also, doctors have attributed the triggering of fibro to severe physical trauma.

One, it was very reminiscent of a relationship that I was once in.  Two, as an actor currently studying acting, I was fascinated by the performances and their varying techniques/approaches to their characters/styles, etc.  Their work was all so intimate that I almost felt voyueristic watching it at times, especially Bill Murray.  And I thought it was a beautiful story about a remarkable connection between two people.  That human quality is something I enjoy in movies...  3)  I thank God that taste changes over time, or I'd still be listening to my 'Rainbow Brite' LP about 50 times a day.  I agree with Johnathan that the tastes in almost anything (food, music, activities, films, etc.) that I've 'outgrown,' so to speak, will always hold a nostalgic value for me, even if I don't engage in them with any frequency anymore.  4)  Comfort is my new favorite restaurant...FRIED OKRA!!!  5)  Today was my first day of classes, and while I'm excited about the resurgence of productivity in my daily schedule, it absolute whooped my fibro-ridden ass.

"8481",8481,734562,"Libra","           That's interesting Johnathan.  In regards to music I have an eclectic taste.  I like the rock music of the 70's and 80's since they represent a much simpler and generally more enjoyable time of my life (nostalgia).  I can't stand most of today's music, partly based on lyrics/topics and partly based on the music itself.  I love big band music (Glenn Miller, Benny Goodman, et. al) probably because I played alot of that in the jazz bands I was in in high school and college.  But for straight artistry, I love classical music (in the general definition of orchestral music).  Bach, Beethoven Tchaichovsky, Mussorgsky, Rossini, Copland, Wagner, Gershwin, even some Bernstein, and on and on.  When I get a chance and have had a stressful day or week, I lay flat on my back in front of the speakers and listen to some of this music, lose myself in the intricacies of the music and end up feeling much more relaxed and focused.  Sorry for drifting off topic there, but my point was that I had never thought about the fact that my taste in music has not changed much over the years and how that relates to heart and mind.  That would be an interesting study (what do changes in taste of art reflect on the growth of person?)  I bet some doctoral candidate has studied that at some point.         "

There are houses and people floating around you, disappearing into the water. Nature is showing all its destructive power and is ripping everything away with it.

It's probably more accurate to say what I 'like' changes over time, while what I admire or value remains the same.  I will always admire and value the craft and artistry of Pink Floyd.  But I rarely listen to them anymore.  When I do, I find I'm only visiting old stomping grounds.  The appeal is only in appreciation of craft and nostalgia for a time or place.  I am grateful for what they gave me at that time, but I now go to other sources for meaning or sustenance.  That said, I experience my changes in preference as a slow continuum.  If they happen rapidly for you, perhaps it is as I initially proposed -- that your relationship with art is largely, if not exclusively, personal and emotional.

"8487",8487,734562,"Libra","           Miriam -- From my observation of your reactions to movies and music over the years, I think it's safe to say that content is the key for you.  If the content doesn't connect, you won't like the film.  In that sense, it seems likely that you prefer either filmed essays or escapist tales.  There's nothing wrong with this; it's just seems to be how you relate to the arts.  That said, I suspect that Lost in Translation did not get you because the content wasn't engaging.  Because without the content, I feel there is plenty of evidence throughout that it is still a strong example of storytelling, character exploration, and filmcraft.  It seems to me that you approach the arts as a seeker -- a seeker of either ideas or entertainment -- rather than as an aesthete.  There is nothing invalid about approaching a work solely as a seeker; but the more personal the quest, the more limited the experience.  As for myself, the film connected profoundly with me, both personally and aesthetically.  I suspect that the film's content did not resonate with any aspect of your own personal search, and was promptly (and validly, for you) dismissed in all remaining categories.         "

"8489",8489,734562,"Libra","           Nick - According to the book, what was the most scandalous thing going on?  I don't have time to read much anymore, and have never really read any non-fiction political books.  I only point to the vote counting since that is what the two rulings from the Supreme Court were about and the origin of the 'Selected, not Elected' mantra that Jesse Jackson and others continue to throw out.  I read part of the Greg Palast link.  If that is part of what you are referring to, then I would have to ask about the military absentee ballots that were discarded because they did not have post marks?  While certainly not a monolithic block ,the majority of military votes got to the Republicans.  These soldiers were serving in Bosnia and Saudi Arabia and Korea, but their votes were discarded because of a technicality of the military postal system.  There is no fool proof system.  To assert that the incompetence / laziness of the company (IBT?) was deliberate a full 7 months in advance of the election assigns them the power of clairvoiance to know that the election was going to be decided by the extremely close margin it was.  There is also the assumption that all of the people that were scrubbed (terrible word IMO) would have a) voted and b) voted for Gore (and not Bush or any of the other 5 or 6 candidates).  I don't think you will find many people who live in the real world that think that the 2000 election nationwide, not just in Florida, was unflawed.  There was the judge in St. Louis who ordered the polls to remain open 3 or 4 hours longer in one area for a reason that I can't recall.  That area just happened to be a largely black area and one where the Democrats were going door to door to get people to go vote.  There was also the 'math error' that led the networks to call Florida before the polls has closed.  It is impossible to know how many, if any, people in the panhandle, a largely Republican area, did not bother to vote because of this announcement.  Then there was the voter incompetence in Palm Beach(?) where the people did not know how to read the ballot.  The ballot they used there was the same type used in Chesterfield, and it was 100% clear to me.  It was a mess.  Back to a conversation from many months ago, I think many of the problems (election wise) would be solved if our participation in the process was increased. 50% for the presidential election is downright pathetic.  The reason I think it would be solved is that I think the Democrats would win handily as they have done a better job of selling class warfare (rich vs. poor) and convincing the 'working class' that the government is the answer to everything when compared to the Republican belief that less governemnt is better.  The Democrats message sells better if you don't dig into it, so it would win.  Count me as one of the yays on the legitimacy of the election.  I have no idea on the commission.  Who was supposed to running it?         "

About the militarisation of space, I agree with John that it looks like being inevitable at this point - not that I think we should be happy with that.  That NASA is the mechanism via which the public can be made to fund military research is nothing new, either.  Most high technology, from telecoms to nuclear weapons, is a result of public subsidies. The main  raison d'etre  of the Pentagon system was to set up this system. Once the public has paid the cost, the technology gets turned over to private enterprise to collect the profits (I believe the term for this is 'free enterprise').  And if the private enterprise gets in trouble, the public bails them out. Yay! Risk-free capitalism!   We have satellites and computers because the Pentagon and NASA covered for it (in the US - we have our own versions too, of course.  I think Alan Turing got military funding, for instance, although don't quote me.). These things are now profitable, so they get handed over to big private corporations.  This is an open secret - it's not talked about much in public, since most people don't like it when they realise they're paying to make rich people even richer, and effectively underwriting any risk, but on the other hand it needs to be known in the right sectors because, well, companies have to know where their free money's coming from.  urlLink  'This transfer between public and private industry is called Spinoff at NASA.'   The Bush stealing the election thing...  It's funny how every pro-Bush comment I ever read focuses on ballot-counting and chads, as though those were the most scandalous things going on.  The best book I've read on the Florida debacle is  The Best Democracy Money Can Buy .  Honestly, I didn't even think it was controversial to say he stole it, but the front page of today's Independent says that 54 per cent of Americans believe he was legitimately elected.  What's your impression in the belly of the beast?  Also, can anyone point me to the investigative commission that concluded it was stolen?   urlLink Greg Palast  told me about it, but we were interrupted as he was telling me where to find it and I haven't had much luck searching online.

"8504",8504,734562,"Libra","           'The space program is bullshit.' - Don't hold back, tell us how you really feel!  ;)  Seriously though, is it the whole space program or just this latest decision/pronouncement you don't like?  We have and continue to enjoy the after effects of the initial Apollo missions with the spin off technologies.  I don't see that we will have the same boost as we got in the 60's from this, but that is the great thing about technology - you don't know about something useful until someone invents it.  '...the fact that over 9 million Americans (including myself) are unemployed...' - What exactly makes someone unemployed?  Is my wife unemployed?  She has no paying job but also does not want one right now.  Is she included in those statistics?  What about the artist/actor who does not have a job because they are busy trying to get a part or find a patron?  They could at least respond to any of the fast food restaurants that always have 'Now Hiring' signs out front.  Are they included?  9 out of roughly 250 is 4%, which I think is lower than the rates I had heard (~6%), so it makes my wonder even more as to exactly how they come up with the numbers.  It just proves the saying that there are three types of information - lies, damn lies, and statistics.  Note that I am not saying that we don't have too much unemployment.  I would love for there to be 0%, but short of the government hiring anyone without a job to do something, I don't think the government has the responsibility or even power to do anything about it.  '...our economy has continuously gone downhill ...' - The economic downturn/recession/depression/dip/or whatever the hell you want to call it began noticeably in March of 2000 when the stock market went through its 'correction' (I hate that term, but that's what they call it).  The NASDAQ went from 5000 to 2000 in something like 6 weeks and the NYSE had a similar drop, taking down many peoples retirement and college education savings with it.  A friend of mine stupidly was holding the money he had made from the sale of his house in NASDAQ and watched it get reduced to about 1/4 of the original amount.  Let's see, I believe that in March of 2000, Governor Bush was trying to secure the Republican nomination for the White House.  And let's see, yeah I can see where President Bush was directly responsible for allowing the terrorist attacks that lead to the deaths of ~3,300 people, shaking our country to it's core, and causing an already weak economy to weaken further.  But the really bad news for the argument is that the economy has grown for the last two quarters and the highest rates in 20 years.  '...Bush stole the presidency...' - Sigh.  Miriam, help me out here.  How many times have I addressed this one in the last 3 years?  20?  I know that Eva was not here for them, so I will state my response again.  There are laws in place in every state that govern the way public elections are to be held.  They were followed in Florida, but Al Gore wanted to change them so that the ballots would be counted again (making three times if I remember correctly).  Bush appealed to the State Supreme Court, which upheld the decision to go ahead and recount.  Bush then appealed to the US Supreme Court, who finally voted 5-4 to stop the recounts and declare a winner based on the votes counted.  The Democrats cried foul and this was partisan politics.  If it had truly been partisan, the vote would have been 7-2, as that is the breakdown of R vs. D appointees.  What that showed to me was that the court was deeply divided, but made a ruling and it was carried out without the violence that probably would have occurred in other countries.  The Democrats keep bringing up the 500,000 more votes that Gore received.  If our system of elections was based on straight count, then that would be a valid point.  But, since the US Constitution clearly spells out the Electoral College process, it does not matter.  What the Democrats should be doing is trying to shore up support in the states where they were close, transferring the popular vote to electoral votes and possibly a White House win (shudder).  As a side note, one or two of the Florida newspapers went back after the fact and counted the ballots.  There was a slight change in the numbers, but Bush still won the state by some ridiculously close margin (around 200 votes).  '...(1)poorly thought out, and (2)expensive, (3)publicity stunt.' - (1) I don't think it is poorly thought out.  All that he has done is to set a target.  Was Kennedy's proclamation poorly thought out in 1961?  (2) Yes it will be  (3)  Probably so.  But then again, anytime a President announces something, it can probably be considered a publicity stunt or at the very least politically motivated (see the recent immigration announcement)  'He's just cutting funding and jobs from other NASA programs. '  - Would you rather he keep funding them and come up with the money from, say, Medicare?  Will any of those people, say working on the Space Shuttle, be able to transfer to the new programs?  I would hope so.  I found out with some dismay this weekend that Sean O'Keefe (NASA administrator) announced that the next HST maintenance mission has been scrubbed.  The current gyros have a 50% chance of failing in the next year and 75% within the next two years.  Once they go, Hubble will not be usable.  Additionally, the mission was going to boost it into a higher orbit.  Without this, it sounds like Hubble will reenter the atmosphere sometime in the next 2-4 years.  The replacement telescope is not scheduled to be launched until 2008-2011.   Congratulations on the upcoming wedding.         "

"8508",8508,734562,"Libra","           Ben - If that was intended as a response to my question, it failed.  I'm not asking what an anti-Bush website thinks about it, I'm asking what my fellow bloggers think about it.  In response to the website, for us, the USA, to think that space will remain unmilitarized forever is naive.  Especially since out good buddies in the Peoples Republic of China are rapidly developing their own space program, and I believe have announced plans for a moon mission (though my memory is vague on that).  They see us as a threat, rightly or wrongly, and we must be prepared.  Someone told me that space exploration is alot like having kids; if you wait until you are ready, it will never happen.  I can see his point.  We, the human species, have been trying to solve some of these pressing social problems (poverty, injustice) for about 3000 years now.  Sometimes with good effects (Roman and Greek rule was pretty good) and sometimes with bad (medieval Europe).  If we wait until the social problems are solved, then I don't think we will ever do it.         "
"8509",8509,734562,"Libra","           MISSION TO MARS FOR MILITARY BENEFIT, NOT JUST 'SPIRIT OF DISCOVERY'  President Bush unveiled his proposal for a new space program Wednesday by invoking the spirit of explorers Lewis and Clark, saying, 'They made that journey in the spirit of discovery... America has ventured forth into space for the same reasons.'   But the president didn't mention that members of his administration view space as the next frontier for military buildup and conquest.  Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld chaired the Commission to Assess United States National Security Space Management and Organization four years ago, releasing its findings in January 2001. Rumsfeld's report found that 'we know from history that every medium -- air, land and sea -- has seen conflict. Reality indicates that space will be no different.'  The panel also concluded that 'given this virtual certainty, the [United States] must develop the means both to deter and to defend against hostile acts in and from space.'  The president's focus on space exploration because it 'improves our lives, and lifts our national spirit.' However, behind the scenes, USA Today reported that Bush was persuaded to move forward in part due to the military benefits, as promoted to him by Vice President Cheney.   The Center for American Progress' Progress Report yesterday noted an appearance by Republican Congressman Tom Feeney on Scarborough Country where he stated, 'Somebody is going to dominate space.  When they do, just like when the British dominated the naval part of our globe, established their empire, just like the United States has dominated the air superiority, ultimately, whoever is able to dominate space will be able to control the destiny of the entire Earth.'  Feeney's comments echo PNAC's September 2000 report Rebuilding America's Defenses, which said, 'Much as control of the high seas - and the protection of international commerce defined global power in the past, so will control of the new 'international commons' be a key to world power in the future.'    urlLink -Bush Aims for Mars to Dominate Space Militarily          "
"8510",8510,734562,"Libra","           Thanks Mir, I was starting to wonder if I had fallen into an alternate reality where we agreed on things!  I am having fun watch the Democrats tear at each other in Iowa.  Now that Dean has abandoned his no attacking policy, I wonder how long it will be before Edwards does as well.  I am also curious as to why Wes Clark is spending so much money on TV ads in Virginia at this early juncture.  While it is a very good introctory ad, I have seen it enough times now to have a couple of questions about its veracity.  I am not saying that he has lied or even stretched the truth, but I don't think he has put forth the whole truth.  I really doubt that he had much to do with the actually negotiating the peace in Serbia.  He probably had a roll, but we have diplomats to handle these things and soldiers to enforce them.  Also, he comments that this was done without the loss of American lives.  The biggest difference is that we went in to an area where they hate each other (Serbs/Croats) more than they hate us.  In Iraq, the insurgents hate us, not the Shiites/Sunnis.  Yet again, I still have not heard a proposed answer to the situation (other than Dean's saying we need to pull out totally, now).  If you want to lead, you need to have answers, not just point out the obvious problems.         "

"8513",8513,734562,"Libra","           When I first heard that President Bush was going to propose going back to the Moon, I will admit that I was extremely skeptical on the reasoning.  We've been to the moon, kicked around the dust, and gotten the t-shirt.  What's the point?  I wanted there to be a larger goal - Mars.  So, I was initially happy about the recent announcement.  But, the more I think about, the more I question it.  Don't get me wrong, I still am in favor of it, but I'm not sure that we will see the benefits of the initial establishment of the NASA with all the new technology, which is what everyone in NASA seems to be touting as a reason to do this.  Computers are already improving at a rate that puts them ahead of the software designed to tax them.  We are constantly developing new and better materials (plastics, polymers, ceramics) and other electronics.  I don't see where the demands of this new mission are going to have much trickle down into daily society.  Sure, there will be localized job benefits to the areas that get work on certain aspects of the project, but unless we get our kids back where they should be in math and science, those jobs will go non-Americans.  So, I am in support of the mission, with some reservations.  How about the rest of the blog?         "
"8514",8514,734562,"Libra","           Warning - The following post is given a grade of F for political correctness because it is anti-tax, and somewhat pro-smoker.  I have been listening to the governor talk about the need to overhaul our state tax system.  The one that troubles me most is the increase to the cigarette tax.  I have heard that Virginia has one of the lowest, if not the lowest, tax per pack.  That seems to be the overwhelming reason given to raise it.  If the revenue generated from this increase was to go directly to treating the illnesses of smokers with no reduction in the current amounts going there (i.e. an increase in actual spending), I would not have a problem with it.  But, I have observed politicians long enough to know that this will not be the case.  I point to the Virginia Lottery as my case in point.  When we (the voters) were sold on the concept of a lottery, we were told that all the profits would go to education.  The good news is that the politicians held true to their word for once.  The bad news is that the amount of money that had been coming from the general fund has dropped dramatically.  Basically, they used the lottery to fund something that everyone agrees needs it, in order to be able to increase some other programs.  I do not doubt that our current politicians would do the same thing with a cigarette tax.  Now, if they are just trying to raise more general revenue, this is also not a good idea.  I point to New York City as an example for this one.  They recently, within the last 2 years, raised the per pack tax to some astronomical level, like $5 a pack.  This was intended to help ease their budget problems.  Instead, they ended up with a larger deficit than before because all this revenue failed to appear.  The reason?  Smokers, despite there lack of heeding the warnings of the danger, aren't stupid.  They know that they can go someplace else to get their cigarettes and have done so.  Heck, I'm sure that some entrepreneurs did the math and realized that they could make several trips to Virginia, load up on lots of cartons, and took them back to New York where they sold them for a hefty markup but still less than the 'legal' packs.  The bottom line, to me anyway, is that getting whatever amount we get now is better than gambling that we won't lose more by raising the rates.  I know that Julie's parents get many cartons to take back to Florida whenever they pass through because of the price difference.  They aren't the only ones.  If you raise the rate, much of this business will dry up.         "

Then, it is going to be very hard to accept a dog in your life when you turn 51.  Same with gay marriage.

"8558",8558,734562,"Libra","           I agree that it isn't ideology.  I was just tossing that out as a random statement.  As to the press conference, it is the press asking the questions, not either of the two leading candidates.  It is one of the roles of the press to reveal that those in power have feet of clay.  That said, it is also one of the roles of a police force to protect its citizens.  Some police officers reach beyond the originally-intended boundaries, pursuing that end proactively rather than reactively, through violence, profiling, or similiar strategies.  Such acts do not represent a flaw in the role; only in its interpretation and execution.  Likewise, the press occasionally (some would argue frequently) reaches beyond the originally-intended boundaries, in the interpretation and execution of its role.  In both cases, the flaw lies in an unrelated entity that has grafted itself onto, or even assimilated itself into, the original whole:  for the former, that foreign presence might be racism or ideology; for the latter, I would argue that the unwelcome intruder is advertising revenue, of which there is a finite amount, and which is determined by a publisher's ability to make the audience feel equally happy, sad, and superior.  This is not to say that the press is absolved of responsibility; I only add it as a probable explanation.  I don't think that in this situation the press is revealing a flaw in its calling, which I fully support.  Nor do I think that the press is revealing any particular ideological preference.  I think it smells a potentional story, and in its eagerness to get that story placed between lucrative advertising spots that require the largest possible audience, it displays not so much a mindless hunger, but rather an embarassing clumsiness in how it goes about its business.  Case in point:  It displays neither skill nor intelligence to grill someone at a press conference.  This isn't sharp and cunning journalism; it's grandstanding at best, simple rudeness at worst.  Take the potential lead and go snooping around the back doors.  Set out the honey and wait for the flies.  Watching the press conference live on cable yesterday, I was struck only by the mutual train wreck:  journalists behaving like a pack of dogs, and a poor government functionary who made a wrong choice a long time ago and now believes in the empty role he performs.  I still long for clever heroes and cunning villains who deserve respectful cheers and boos.  I am no longer interested in thugs and bullies, no matter what color hat they may wear.         "

Burkett said that a few days later at Camp Mabry in Austin, he saw Mr. Bushs file and documents from it discarded in a trash can. He said he recognized the documents as retirement point summaries and pay forms.            "

Joe Conason's Journal On Sunday, NBC's Tim Russert is scheduled to interview the president. Here are five questions he'll definitely want to ask.  Editor's note: This will be the last daily installment of Joe Conason's Journal. Beginning next week, look for less frequent but more in-depth investigative reports and commentary -- on the Bush administration and other political topics -- from Conason, every week in Salon.  Feb. 5, 2004  |  Tim Russert, dream interviewer  NBC's Tim Russert cherishes a reputation as network television's bulldog interrogator of wayward politicians. His image is good cop/bad cop in the same guy. This coming Sunday, the president will reportedly appear on 'Meet the Press.' That decision may well reflect, as Nick Confessore suggested today, Karl Rove's confidence that Russert isn't really so goddamned tough, especially not on Republicans. If so, Rove would be in rare agreement with many of Russert's critics on the left.   Knowing Russert, I think he would hate to confirm such nasty suspicions when he interviews George W. Bush (although he would also hasten to plead that some partisans on both sides are never satisfied, etc.). Let's help him with a few questions (and follow-ups) that nobody could call softballs:      1. Given the controversy about your attendance record during your National Guard service, Mr. President, perhaps the best way to resolve matters would be to authorize the release of all of your military records, including pay stubs, Social Security records and so-called retirement-points records. Will you do that? If not, why not, and how can the American people believe that you actually fulfilled your service obligations as everyone else in the Guard was required to do?   2. Mr. President, on page 54 of your autobiography, 'A Charge to Keep,' you wrote: 'I continued flying with my unit for the next several years.' But the truth is that you quit flying after less than two years, despite fighter training that cost the taxpayers almost a million dollars. Did your superiors approve your decision to quit flying, or did you just quit on your own? Weren't you suspended from flying in August 1972 after you failed to take a required physical exam? Why didn't you take that physical?     3. Mr. President, I'd like to ask you about the now-famous 'mission accomplished' speech you gave on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln outside San Diego last May. You landed on the carrier in a flight suit -- a piece of videotape shown around the world. [Roll tape.] A lot of your critics were appalled by that image. Here's a man who never fought in a war, never saw the danger and horrors of real combat, dressing up like a soldier and proclaiming a victory that, as it turned out, we were far from accomplishing. As you look back on it, has it ever occurred to you, that Eisenhower, who won D-day, never dressed in uniform when he was president; John F. Kennedy, who was a genuine war hero, never dressed in uniform either. Was there something disrespectful to the military in a costume stunt like that? Your thoughts, sir.   4. You have blamed the rapidly rising, unsustainable federal deficits on 'out-of-control' domestic spending. But Mr. President, the plain fact, according to every nonpartisan analyst, is that your tax cuts are responsible for a far greater percentage of present and future deficits than spending. Your current budget proposal cuts billions in programs for children and veterans. Wouldn't it be more compassionate -- and more responsible -- to rescind some of the tax breaks for the very wealthiest Americans?   5. Sir, with respect, most economists say that the tax cuts are responsible for no more than 20 percent of the recent economic growth, and that the recession could have been addressed with a short-term stimulus primarily aimed at middle- and working-class tax payers, rather than long-term tax cuts tilted toward the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers. These long-term tax cuts for the wealthy are the major cause for these massive structural deficits that we now have and the complete inability to fund some of these programs for children, the elderly and veterans. How does that reflect responsible Republicanism or compassionate conservatism?   You may say that I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one.             "

Today a federal judge ruled a Virginia law passed last year (I think) outlawing the so called partial birth abortion procedure as unconstitutional.  I don't know the specifics of his ruling or what the law says, and that is not my question.  What I do not understand is under what situation is the pregnant woman's life in danger enough to end the pregnancy but not enough that it is 'safe' to undergo as much of the birth process as this does.  I use safe in quotes because nothing about the birthing process is without danger.  As much as doctors know, they still don't understand all the vagaries of child birth.  Please don't respond with a flame, because I have not desire to argue this issue, merely to have someone fill me in on something I may be missing about this particular procedure.         "

According to the Federal Times, the president's appointee at the Office of Special Counsel ruled that federal employees will now 'have no recourse if they are fired or demoted simply for being gay.' (2)   While the Bush Administration says it is legally prohibited from firing a person for their conduct, they have the legal right to fire or demote someone based on their sexual orientation. To carry out the directive, the White House has begun removing information from government websites about sexual orientation discrimination in the workplace. (3)  Not only does the new directive contradict the president's own promise to treat homosexuals as equals under the law, but it also contradicts what the Administration told Congress. As noted in a bipartisan letter from four Senators to the Administration, 'During the confirmation process [of the president's appointee], you assured us that you were committed to protecting federal employees against unlawful discrimination related to their sexual orientation.'

I have yet to see it.  I think I'd prefer to see it privately in my own home, because my faith is very strong and very personal to me.  I feel like I might leave the film feeling like an open wound, and I don't want to risk being around insensitivity at a moment like that...  But as for the way it is marketed...  The movie business is still just that...a business.  It is an unfortunate reality that, if you want to put asses in seats, you have to have some sort of draw.  Since James Caviezel is not yet an A-List celebrity (though I think he could be...he's a brilliant actor), his name alone is not enough.  And while many people love Mel Gibson, the masses of asses in seats tend to prefer a Mel that is in front of the camera, not behind it.  So producers, wanting to make money on a film that they know is monetarily risky, come up with a way to sell the film, i.e., 'the TRUE story of WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.'  Whether or not it is historically accurate does not matter to me.  As Harmonium touched upon, truth and fact are not synonymous.  After the release of 'The Killing Fields,' director Roland Joffe asked one of the journalists, on whose experiences the film was based, if the film was accurate.  He replied with a yes and no.  No, he said, that's not exactly what really happened.  But yes, he said, that's exactly what it  felt  like.            "

"8645",8645,734562,"Libra","           On a side note about 'faith'...  This past weekend, two ladies came to my door.  After greetings were passed, one promptly asked me, and I paraphrase, 'Do you think you are going to Heaven when you die?'.  My response was a prompt but polite 'No.'.  They appeared shocked and asked me why.  I said that you can't go someplace that doesn't exist.  I explained that I am an atheist, and I believe that 'there is no god, or satan, or heaven, hell'.  And their response was, 'but you have to have faith in that, right?'  She went on to say that when you sit in a chair, do you thoroughly inspect it first, or do you just go and sit down?  Meaning that you have to have faith that the chair will support you, and won't fall apart.  My question is this....Since when did religion trademark the word 'faith' as only pertaining to ones belief in a deity of some sort.  Why is it that if I have faith, then I must in some way or another believe in god?  No offense to the christians out there, but it really pissed me off.         "
"8646",8646,734562,"Libra","           ...and that's what bugged me enough to post; that the film maker went out of his way to make the film 'historically accurate', but then dropped the ball on the color issue.  regardless of one's opinion on Jesus' ethnicity (or at least, that of people living in the Middle East during the time period he supposedly lived in), the actors could have at least been a  little  darker skinned - they all lived in a desert, for pete's sake!  you could have had a chinese guy playing christ in a snowstorm, as long as you didn't expect me to look at your film as a depiction of how the people and places 'really looked', which is what gibson's film purports to do (and succeeded in doing in many other ways, apparently).  but is that really the point when you're telling 'the greatest story ever told'?  shouldn't even a pretty good story be able stand on its own, in regards to its message(s)?  shakespeare's plays can be set in any time period, and they work fine; no one balks at the inevitable 'anachronisms', because his were universal stories from the get-go.  i wish more christians would do the same, by acknowledging the power of allegory to promote faith and belief, rather than insisting that the events in their stories have to have 'really happened' to be significant.    it doesn't matter if jesus ever really existed, anymore than odysseus or buddha or any number of characters in the great stories of our species; what matters is the message, not the messenger (or the creed).  what we learn about  ourselves  in reading about these folk is what matters.  in another thousand years, all of them will have been modified tenfold to suit the cultures and opinions of times to come, just as they have been many times before.  hopefully, the essence of the stories will persist and prevail - and not because we ever felt the need to prove that they 'really happened', which is all but impossible, and in my opinion, needless.          "
"8647",8647,734562,"Libra","           For myself, the historicity of a representation of a figure such as Jesus or the Buddha is completely irrelevant.  What matters to me are the words and the act(s).  My own research has revealed that Gibson intended to film an interpretation, albeit one that is more 'gritty' and 'violent.'  In that sense -- and in that sense only -- it seems that the film can be tested against realism.  In terms of event and image, it is, like all films, a personal visual exploration.  As Ebert often says, a movie is not about what it is about, but how it is about it.  As a sidenote, there is a curious need in modern society to equate 'veracity' with 'truth,' as if they have anything at all to do with each other.  At least once a year, a newsmagazine devotes a cover story to the 'real Jesus,' the 'real Muhammed,' the 'real Whoever' -- as if evidence matters in the search for truth.  Evidence yields nothing but data.  Data has its uses, and for many from the 18th century Enlightenment onward, its presence can evoke deep satisfaction -- but in the great cocktail party of the universe, beyond nodding to each other at the cheese table, data and faith have very little to talk about.         "
"8648",8648,734562,"Libra","           I'm mixed on this aspect of the film.  While it is Mel Gibson's right to create a film with his own artistic vision, it then comes down to whether the film is being done with a heavy influence of historical accuracy OR simply being made from ones own interpretation of an event.  This picture seems to be made as the latter.  And like Harmonium said, I don't have a problem with that.  But you can't also try and market that same product as being historically accurate, when it just isn't.....if indeed that is what is being done.         "

As far as the movie is concerned, and no I haven't seen it, I've heard that they don't have a single black person in the movie.

The Cobb County schools' disclaimer, in the form of a sticker on the inside front cover of textbooks, could have the effect of advancing or inhibiting religion, U.S. District Judge Clarence Cooper ruled in ordering the suit to go to trial.     'We're very excited about this,' said attorney Michael Manely, who represents the six Cobb County parents who sued the system in August 2002.   The lawsuit argues that the disclaimer restricts the teaching of evolution, promotes and requires the teaching of creationism and discriminates against particular religions.         The sticker reads: 'This textbook contains material on evolution. Evolution is a theory, not a fact, regarding the origin of living things. This material should be approached with an open mind, studied carefully and critically considered.'   The judge weighed the constitutionality of the issue by applying a three-pronged test handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1971. In order to get the lawsuit dismissed, the school board had to show that the disclaimer was adopted with a secular purpose; that its primary effect neither advances nor inhibits religion; and that it does not result in an excessive entanglement of government with religion.   In his order signed last Wednesday, Cooper said the school board satisfied him on the first issue.   But he noted that while the disclaimer has no biblical reference, it encourages students to consider alternatives other than evolution. The judge found that the disclaimer could have the effect of advancing or inhibiting religion.   'Indeed, most of the board members concurred that they wanted students to consider other alternatives,' Cooper wrote.   The theory of evolution, accepted by most scientists, says evidence shows current species of life evolved over time from earlier forms and that natural selection determines which species survive. Creationism credits the origin of species to God.   In 1987, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled creationism was a religious belief that could not be taught in public schools along with evolution.             "

We're still gathering information, so take none of this as firm word, but what seems to have happened, happened quickly.  He woke up, got up out of bed...and went down.  The paramedics who showed up suggested it was either an aneurysm or a massive stroke.  His family members have been informed, and all of the the cast have, as far as we can determine, also been informed.    This is a terrible loss for all of us.  Richard was a consummate professional but more than that he was an honorable, stand-up guy.  If he gave you his word on something, you never had to wonder about it afterward.  He was always helpful and supportive of all the cast, even those who only came in for one episode, always with a ready smile and determined to do whatever it took to make the scene work.  He was, quite simply, a terrific guy, and everyone here is just devastated at the news.  More word as this develops.  We may try to have some kind of fund raiser to help give whatever assistance may be helpful for his kids.  We all miss him terribly.   jms     UPDATE: here's the  urlLink CNN  article concerning his passing.         "

In fact, I owe an apology to fans of the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy.    When Richard Roeper reviewed the current two-disc DVD of 'Lord of the Rings: Return of the King' on TV, I noted that a four-disc set of the movie was coming out later this year. He observed that the complete trilogy will come out on 'an accordion size set that will take up the next six years of your life.' I observed that 'LOTR' fans should 'get a life.' I meant this as an affectionate ironic throwaway, but have received dozens of wounded e-mails from Ring devotees who believe 'LOTR' has, indeed, given them a life, and after seeing 'The Chronicles of Riddick,' I agree. They have a life. The prospect of become an expert on 'Riddick,' in contrast, is too depressing to contemplate.'         "

Gave Advice in 2002  By Dana Priest and R. Jeffrey Smith Washington Post Staff Writers Tuesday, June 8, 2004; Page A01    In August 2002, the Justice Department advised the White House that torturing al Qaeda terrorists in captivity abroad 'may be justified,' and that international laws against torture 'may be unconstitutional if applied to interrogations' conducted in President Bush's war on terrorism, according to a newly obtained memo.          If a government employee were to torture a suspect in captivity, 'he would be doing so in order to prevent further attacks on the United States by the Al Qaeda terrorist network,' said the memo, from the Justice Department's office of legal counsel, written in response to a CIA request for legal guidance. It added that arguments centering on 'necessity and self-defense could provide justifications that would eliminate any criminal liability' later.   The memo seems to counter the pre-Sept. 11, 2001, assumption that U.S. government personnel would never be permitted to torture captives. It was offered after the CIA began detaining and interrogating suspected al Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the wake of the attacks, according to government officials familiar with the document.   The legal reasoning in the 2002 memo, which covered treatment of al Qaeda detainees in CIA custody, was later used in a March 2003 report by Pentagon lawyers assessing interrogation rules governing the Defense Department's detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. At that time, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld had asked the lawyers to examine the logistical, policy and legal issues associated with interrogation techniques.   Bush administration officials say flatly that, despite the discussion of legal issues in the two memos, it has abided by international conventions barring torture, and that detainees at Guantanamo and elsewhere have been treated humanely, except in the cases of abuse at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq for which seven military police soldiers have been charged.   Still, the 2002 and 2003 memos reflect the Bush administration's desire to explore the limits on how far it could legally go in aggressively interrogating foreigners suspected of terrorism or of having information that could thwart future attacks.   In the 2002 memo, written for the CIA and addressed to White House Counsel Alberto R. Gonzales, the Justice Department defined torture in a much narrower way, for example, than does the U.S. Army, which has historically carried out most wartime interrogations.   In the Justice Department's view -- contained in a 50-page document signed by Assistant Attorney General Jay S. Bybee and obtained by The Washington Post -- inflicting moderate or fleeting pain does not necessarily constitute torture. Torture, the memo says, 'must be equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or even death.'   By contrast, the Army's Field Manual 34-52, titled 'Intelligence Interrogations,' sets more restrictive rules. For example, the Army prohibits pain induced by chemicals or bondage; forcing an individual to stand, sit or kneel in abnormal positions for prolonged periods of time; and food deprivation. Under mental torture, the Army prohibits mock executions, sleep deprivation and chemically induced psychosis.   Human rights groups expressed dismay at the Justice Department's legal reasoning yesterday.   'It is by leaps and bounds the worst thing I've seen since this whole Abu Ghraib scandal broke,' said Tom Malinowski of Human Rights Watch. 'It appears that what they were contemplating was the commission of war crimes and looking for ways to avoid legal accountability. The effect is to throw out years of military doctrine and standards on interrogations.'   But a spokesman for the White House counsel's office said, 'The president directed the military to treat al Qaeda and Taliban humanely and consistent with the Geneva Conventions.'            "

We are here tonight because we love our country.   We are proud of what America is and what it can become.   My fellow Americans: we are here tonight united in one simple purpose: to make America stronger at home and respected in the world.  A great American novelist wrote that you can't go home again.  He could not have imagined this evening.  Tonight, I am home. Home where my public life began and those who made it possible live.  Home where our nation's history was written in blood, idealism, and hope.  Home where my parents showed me the values of family, faith, and country.  Thank you, all of you, for a welcome home I will never forget.   I wish my parents could share this moment.  They went to their rest in the last few years, but their example, their inspiration, their gift of open eyes, open mind, and endless world are bigger and more lasting than any words.  I was born in Colorado, in Fitzsimmons Army Hospital, when my dad was a pilot in World War II.  Now, I'm not one to read into things, but guess which wing of the hospital the maternity ward was in?  I'm not making this up.  I was born in the West Wing!  My mother was the rock of our family as so many mothers are. She stayed up late to help me do my homework. She sat by my bed when I was sick, and she answered the questions of a child who, like all children, found the world full of wonders and mysteries.  She was my den mother when I was a Cub Scout and she was so proud of her fifty year pin as a Girl Scout leader. She gave me her passion for the environment.  She taught me to see trees as the cathedrals of nature. And by the power of her example, she showed me that we can and must finish the march toward full equality for all women in our country.   My dad did the things that a boy remembers.  He gave me my first model airplane, my first baseball mitt and my first bicycle.  He also taught me that we are here for something bigger than ourselves; he lived out the responsibilities and sacrifices of the greatest generation to whom we owe so much.    When I was a young man, he was in the State Department, stationed in Berlin when it and the world were divided between democracy and communism. I have unforgettable memories of being a kid mesmerized by the British, French, and American troops, each of them guarding their own part of the city, and Russians standing guard on the stark line separating East from West. On one occasion, I rode my bike into Soviet East Berlin. And when I proudly told my dad, he promptly grounded me.   But what I learned has stayed with me for a lifetime. I saw how different life was on different sides of the same city. I saw the fear in the eyes of people who were not free.  I saw the gratitude of people toward the United States for all that we had done. I felt goose bumps as I got off a military train and heard the Army band strike up 'Stars and Stripes Forever.'  I learned what it meant to be America at our best. I learned the pride of our freedom.  And I am determined now to restore that pride to all who look to America.   Mine were greatest generation parents. And as I thank them, we all join together to thank that whole generation for making America strong, for winning World War II, winning the Cold War, and for the great gift of service which brought America fifty years of peace and prosperity.     My parents inspired me to serve, and when I was a junior in high school, John Kennedy called my generation to service.  It was the beginning of a great journey  a time to march for civil rights, for voting rights, for the environment, for women, and for peace. We believed we could change the world. And you know what? We did.   But we're not finished. The journey isn't complete.  The march isn't over.  The promise isn't perfected.   Tonight, we're setting out again.  And together, we're going to write the next great chapter of America's story.   We have it in our power to change the world again.  But only if we're true to our ideals  and that starts by telling the truth to the American people. That is my first pledge to you tonight.  As President, I will restore trust and credibility to the White House.  I ask you to judge me by my record:  As a young prosecutor, I fought for victim's rights and made prosecuting violence against women a priority.  When I came to the Senate, I broke with many in my own party to vote for a balanced budget, because I thought it was the right thing to do.  I fought to put a 100,000 cops on the street.  And then I reached across the aisle to work with John McCain, to find the truth about our POW's and missing in action, and to finally make peace with Vietnam.     I will be a commander in chief who will never mislead us into war.  I will have a Vice President who will not conduct secret meetings with polluters to rewrite our environmental laws.  I will have a Secretary of Defense who will listen to the best advice of our military leaders.   And I will appoint an Attorney General who actually upholds the Constitution of the United States.   My fellow Americans, this is the most important election of our lifetime. The stakes are high. We are a nation at war  a global war on terror against an enemy unlike any we have ever known before. And here at home, wages are falling, health care costs are rising, and our great middle class is shrinking. People are working weekends; they're working two jobs, three jobs, and they're still not getting ahead.   We're told that outsourcing jobs is good for America. We're told that new jobs that pay $9,000 less than the jobs that have been lost is the best we can do.  They say this is the best economy we've ever had.  And they say that anyone who thinks otherwise is a pessimist.  Well, here is our answer:  There is nothing more pessimistic than saying America can't do better.   We can do better and we will.  We're the optimists. For us, this is a country of the future. We're the can do people.  And let's not forget what we did in the 1990s. We balanced the budget. We paid down the debt.  We created 23 million new jobs. We lifted millions out of poverty and we lifted the standard of living for the middle class. We just need to believe in ourselves  and we can do it again.   So tonight, in the city where America's freedom began, only a few blocks from where the sons and daughters of liberty gave birth to our nation  here tonight, on behalf of a new birth of freedom  on behalf of the middle class who deserve a champion, and those struggling to join it who deserve a fair shot  for the brave men and women in uniform who risk their lives every day and the families who pray for their return  for all those who believe our best days are ahead of us  for all of you  with great faith in the American people, I accept your nomination for President of the United States.   I am proud that at my side will be a running mate whose life is the story of the American dream and who's worked every day to make that dream real for all Americans  Senator John Edwards of North Carolina. And his wonderful wife Elizabeth and their family. This son of a mill worker is ready to lead  and next January, Americans will be proud to have a fighter for the middle class to succeed Dick Cheney as Vice President of the United States.   And what can I say about Teresa?  She has the strongest moral compass of anyone I know. She's down to earth, nurturing, courageous, wise and smart.  She speaks her mind and she speaks the truth, and I love her for that, too. And that's why America will embrace her as the next First Lady of the United States.   For Teresa and me, no matter what the future holds or the past has given us, nothing will ever mean as much as our children. We love them not just for who they are and what they've become, but for being themselves, making us laugh, holding our feet to the fire, and never letting me get away with anything.  Thank you, Andre, Alex, Chris, Vanessa, and John.  And in this journey, I am accompanied by an extraordinary band of brothers led by that American hero, a patriot named Max Cleland.  Our band of brothers doesn't march together because of who we are as veterans, but because of what we learned as soldiers. We fought for this nation because we loved it and we came back with the deep belief that every day is extra.  We may be a little older now, we may be a little grayer, but we still know how to fight for our country.   And standing with us in that fight are those who shared with me the long season of the primary campaign:  Carol Moseley Braun, General Wesley Clark, Howard Dean, Dick Gephardt, Bob Graham, Dennis Kucinich, Joe Lieberman and Al Sharpton.   To all of you, I say thank you for teaching me and testing me  but mostly, we say thank you for standing up for our country and giving us the unity to move America forward.   My fellow Americans, the world tonight is very different from the world of four years ago. But I believe the American people are more than equal to the challenge.   Remember the hours after September 11th, when we came together as one to answer the attack against our homeland. We drew strength when our firefighters ran up the stairs and risked their lives, so that others might live. When rescuers rushed into smoke and fire at the Pentagon.  When the men and women of Flight 93 sacrificed themselves to save our nation's Capitol. When flags were hanging from front porches all across America, and strangers became friends. It was the worst day we have ever seen, but it brought out the best in all of us.    I am proud that after September 11th all our people rallied to President Bush's call for unity to meet the danger. There were no Democrats.  There were no Republicans. There were only Americans.  How we wish it had stayed that way.   Now I know there are those who criticize me for seeing complexities  and I do  because some issues just aren't all that simple.  Saying there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq doesn't make it so.  Saying we can fight a war on the cheap doesnt make it so. And proclaiming mission accomplished certainly doesn't make it so.    As President, I will ask hard questions and demand hard evidence.  I will immediately reform the intelligence system  so policy is guided by facts, and facts are never distorted by politics.  And as President, I will bring back this nation's time-honored tradition: the United States of America never goes to war because we want to, we only go to war because we have to.  I know what kids go through when they are carrying an M-16 in a dangerous place and they can't tell friend from foe.  I know what they go through when they're out on patrol at night and they don't know what's coming around the next bend. I know what it's like to write letters home telling your family that everything's all right when you're not sure that's true.    As President, I will wage this war with the lessons I learned in war.  Before you go to battle, you have to be able to look a parent in the eye and truthfully say: 'I tried everything possible to avoid sending your son or daughter into harm's way. But we had no choice. We had to protect the American people, fundamental American values from a threat that was real and imminent.'  So lesson one, this is the only justification for going to war.   And on my first day in office, I will send a message to every man and woman in our armed forces: You will never be asked to fight a war without a plan to win the peace.  I know what we have to do in Iraq.  We need a President who has the credibility to bring our allies to our side and share the burden, reduce the cost to American taxpayers, and reduce the risk to American soldiers.  That's the right way to get the job done and bring our troops home.   Here is the reality: that won't happen until we have a president who restores America's respect and leadership -- so we don't have to go it alone in the world.    And we need to rebuild our alliances, so we can get the terrorists before they get us.    I defended this country as a young man and I will defend it as President.  Let there be no mistake:  I will never hesitate to use force when it is required.  Any attack will be met with a swift and certain response. I will never give any nation or international institution a veto over our national security.  And I will build a stronger American military.  We will add 40,000 active duty troops  not in Iraq, but to strengthen American forces that are now overstretched, overextended, and under pressure. We will double our special forces to conduct anti-terrorist operations. We will provide our troops with the newest weapons and technology to save their lives  and win the battle.  And we will end the backdoor draft of National Guard and reservists.  To all who serve in our armed forces today, I say, help is on the way.   As President, I will fight a smarter, more effective war on terror. We will deploy every tool in our arsenal: our economic as well as our military might; our principles as well as our firepower.    In these dangerous days there is a right way and a wrong way to be strong. Strength is more than tough words. After decades of experience in national security, I know the reach of our power and I know the power of our ideals.  We need to make America once again a beacon in the world. We need to be looked up to and not just feared.    We need to lead a global effort against nuclear proliferation  to keep the most dangerous weapons in the world out of the most dangerous hands in the world.     We need a strong military and we need to lead strong alliances.  And then, with confidence and determination, we will be able to tell the terrorists: You will lose and we will win.  The future doesn't belong to fear; it belongs to freedom.    And the front lines of this battle are not just far away  they're right here on our shores, at our airports, and potentially in any town or city. Today, our national security begins with homeland security. The 9-11 Commission has given us a path to follow, endorsed by Democrats, Republicans, and the 9-11 families.  As President, I will not evade or equivocate; I will immediately implement the recommendations of that commission.  We shouldn't be letting ninety-five percent of container ships come into our ports without ever being physically inspected.  We shouldn't be leaving our nuclear and chemical plants without enough protection.  And we shouldn't be opening firehouses in Baghdad and closing them down in the United States of America.   And tonight, we have an important message for those who question the patriotism of Americans who offer a better direction for our country.  Before wrapping themselves in the flag and shutting their eyes and ears to the truth, they should remember what America is really all about. They should remember the great idea of freedom for which so many have given their lives.  Our purpose now is to reclaim democracy itself. We are here to affirm that when Americans stand up and speak their minds and say America can do better, that is not a challenge to patriotism; it is the heart and soul of patriotism.   You see that flag up there.  We call her Old Glory. The stars and stripes forever. I fought under that flag, as did so many of you here and all across our country. That flag flew from the gun turret right behind my head. It was shot through and through and tattered, but it never ceased to wave in the wind. It draped the caskets of men I served with and friends I grew up with.  For us, that flag is the most powerful symbol of who we are and what we believe in. Our strength. Our diversity. Our love of country. All that makes America both great and good.   That flag doesn't belong to any president. It doesn't belong to any ideology and it doesn't belong to any political party. It belongs to all the American people.   My fellow citizens, elections are about choices. And choices are about values.  In the end, it's not just policies and programs that matter; the president who sits at that desk must be guided by principle.   For four years, we've heard a lot of talk about values. But values spoken without actions taken are just slogans.  Values are not just words.  They're what we live by. They're about the causes we champion and the people we fight for. And it is time for those who talk about family values to start valuing families.   You don't value families by kicking kids out of after school programs and taking cops off our streets, so that Enron can get another tax break.   We believe in the family value of caring for our children and protecting the neighborhoods where they walk and play.    And that is the choice in this election.   You don't value families by denying real prescription drug coverage to seniors, so big drug companies can get another windfall.    We believe in the family value expressed in one of the oldest Commandments: 'Honor thy father and thy mother.'  As President, I will not privatize Social Security. I will not cut benefits. And together, we will make sure that senior citizens never have to cut their pills in half because they can't afford life-saving medicine.     And that is the choice in this election.  You don't value families if you force them to take up a collection to buy body armor for a son or daughter in the service, if you deny veterans health care, or if you tell middle class families to wait for a tax cut, so that the wealthiest among us can get even more.  We believe in the value of doing what's right for everyone in the American family.   And that is the choice in this election.   We believe that what matters most is not narrow appeals masquerading as values, but the shared values that show the true face of America.  Not narrow appeals that divide us, but shared values that unite us.  Family and faith.  Hard work and responsibility. Opportunity for all  so that every child, every parent, every worker has an equal shot at living up to their God-given potential.  What does it mean in America today when Dave McCune, a steel worker I met in Canton, Ohio, saw his job sent overseas and the equipment in his factory literally unbolted, crated up, and shipped thousands of miles away along with that job?  What does it mean when workers I've met had to train their foreign replacements?    America can do better.  So tonight we say: help is on the way.  What does it mean when Mary Ann Knowles, a woman with breast cancer I met in New Hampshire, had to keep working day after day right through her chemotherapy, no matter how sick she felt, because she was terrified of losing her family's health insurance.   America can do better.  And help is on the way.  What does it mean when Deborah Kromins from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania works and saves all her life only to find out that her pension has disappeared into thin air  and the executive who looted it has bailed out on a golden parachute?   America can do better.  And help is on the way.  What does it mean when twenty five percent of the children in Harlem have asthma because of air pollution?   America can do better.  And help is on the way.  What does it mean when people are huddled in blankets in the cold, sleeping in Lafayette Park on the doorstep of the White House itself  and the number of families living in poverty has risen by three million in the last four years?    America can do better.  And help is on the way.  And so we come here tonight to ask: Where is the conscience of our country?   I'll tell you where it is: it's in rural and small town America; it's in urban neighborhoods and suburban main streets; it's alive in the people I've met in every part of this land. It's bursting in the hearts of Americans who are determined to give our country back its values and its truth.   We value jobs that pay you more not less than you earned before.  We value jobs where, when you put in a week's work, you can actually pay your bills, provide for your children, and lift up the quality of your life.  We value an America where the middle class is not being squeezed, but doing better.   So here is our economic plan to build a stronger America:    First, new incentives to revitalize manufacturing.    Second, investment in technology and innovation that will create the good-paying jobs of the future.    Third, close the tax loopholes that reward companies for shipping our jobs overseas.  Instead, we will reward companies that create and keep good paying jobs where they belong  in the good old U.S.A.    We value an America that exports products, not jobs  and we believe American workers should never have to subsidize the loss of their own job.   Next, we will trade and compete in the world.  But our plan calls for a fair playing field  because if you give the American worker a fair playing field, there's nobody in the world the American worker can't compete against.    And we're going to return to fiscal responsibility because it is the foundation of our economic strength.  Our plan will cut the deficit in half in four years by ending tax giveaways that are nothing more than corporate welfare  and will make government live by the rule that every family has to follow: pay as you go.    And let me tell you what we won't do: we won't raise taxes on the middle class. You've heard a lot of false charges about this in recent months. So let me say straight out what I will do as President: I will cut middle class taxes.  I will reduce the tax burden on small business. And I will roll back the tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals who make over $200,000 a year, so we can invest in job creation, health care and education.   Our education plan for a stronger America sets high standards and demands accountability from parents, teachers, and schools. It provides for smaller class sizes and treats teachers like the professionals they are. And it gives a tax credit to families for each and every year of college.  When I was a prosecutor, I met young kids who were in trouble, abandoned by adults.  And as President, I am determined that we stop being a nation content to spend $50,000 a year to keep a young person in prison for the rest of their life  when we could invest $10,000 to give them Head Start, Early Start, Smart Start, the best possible start in life.  And we value health care that's affordable and accessible for all Americans.  Since 2000, four million people have lost their health insurance. Millions more are struggling to afford it.   You know what's happening. Your premiums, your co-payments, your deductibles have all gone through the roof.  Our health care plan for a stronger America cracks down on the waste, greed, and abuse in our health care system and will save families up to $1,000 a year on their premiums.  You'll get to pick your own doctor  and patients and doctors, not insurance company bureaucrats, will make medical decisions.  Under our plan, Medicare will negotiate lower drug prices for seniors. And all Americans will be able to buy less expensive prescription drugs from countries like Canada.    The story of people struggling for health care is the story of so many Americans. But you know what, it's not the story of senators and members of Congress.  Because we give ourselves great health care and you get the bill. Well, I'm here to say, your family's health care is just as important as any politician's in Washington, D.C.  And when I'm President, America will stop being the only advanced nation in the world which fails to understand that health care is not a privilege for the wealthy, the connected, and the elected  it is a right for all Americans.   We value an America that controls its own destiny because it's finally and forever independent of Mideast oil.  What does it mean for our economy and our national security when we only have three percent of the world's oil reserves, yet we rely on foreign countries for fifty-three percent of what we consume?    I want an America that relies on its own ingenuity and innovation  not the Saudi royal family.   And our energy plan for a stronger America will invest in new technologies and alternative fuels and the cars of the future -- so that no young American in uniform will ever be held hostage to our dependence on oil from the Middle East.  I've told you about our plans for the economy, for education, for health care, for energy independence.  I want you to know more about them.  So now I'm going to say something that Franklin Roosevelt could never have said in his acceptance speech:  go to johnkerry.com.  I want to address these next words directly to President George W. Bush: In the weeks ahead, let's be optimists, not just opponents. Let's build unity in the American family, not angry division. Let's honor this nation's diversity; let's respect one another; and let's never misuse for political purposes the most precious document in American history, the Constitution of the United States.   My friends, the high road may be harder, but it leads to a better place. And that's why Republicans and Democrats must make this election a contest of big ideas, not small-minded attacks. This is our time to reject the kind of politics calculated to divide race from race, group from group, region from region. Maybe some just see us divided into red states and blue states, but I see us as one America  red, white, and blue. And when I am President, the government I lead will enlist people of talent, Republicans as well as Democrats, to find the common ground  so that no one who has something to contribute will be left on the sidelines.  And let me say it plainly: in that cause, and in this campaign, we welcome people of faith. America is not us and them. I think of what Ron Reagan said of his father a few weeks ago, and I want to say this to you tonight: I don't wear my own faith on my sleeve. But faith has given me values and hope to live by, from Vietnam to this day, from Sunday to Sunday. I don't want to claim that God is on our side. As Abraham Lincoln told us, I want to pray humbly that we are on God's side. And whatever our faith, one belief should bind us all: The measure of our character is our willingness to give of ourselves for others and for our country.  These aren't Democratic values. These aren't Republican values. They're American values.  We believe in them. They're who we are. And if we honor them, if we believe in ourselves, we can build an America that's stronger at home and respected in the world.   So much promise stretches before us. Americans have always reached for the impossible, looked to the next horizon, and asked: What if?   Two young bicycle mechanics from Dayton asked what if this airplane could take off at Kitty Hawk?  It did that and changed the world forever.  A young president asked what if we could go to the moon in ten years?  And now we're exploring the solar system and the stars themselves.  A young generation of entrepreneurs asked, what if we could take all the information in a library and put it on a little chip the size of a fingernail?  We did and that too changed the world forever.  And now it's our time to ask: What if?   What if we find a breakthrough to cure Parkinson's, diabetes, Alzheimer's and AIDs?  What if we have a president who believes in science, so we can unleash the wonders of discovery like stem cell research to treat illness and save millions of lives?   What if we do what adults should do  and make sure all our children are safe in the afternoons after school?  And what if we have a leadership that's as good as the American dream  so that bigotry and hatred never again steal the hope and future of any American?  I learned a lot about these values on that gunboat patrolling the Mekong Delta with young Americans who came from places as different as Iowa and Oregon, Arkansas, Florida and California.  No one cared where we went to school.  No one cared about our race or our backgrounds. We were literally all in the same boat. We looked out, one for the other  and we still do.   That is the kind of America I will lead as President  an America where we are all in the same boat.   Never has there been a more urgent moment for Americans to step up and define ourselves. I will work my heart out.  But, my fellow citizens, the outcome is in your hands more than mine.    It is time to reach for the next dream.  It is time to look to the next horizon.  For America, the hope is there.  The sun is rising.  Our best days are still to come.    Goodnight, God bless you, and God bless America.    urlLink johnkerry.com           "

"8761",8761,734562,"Libra","            &nbsp;EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE:    LAW ENFORCEMENT:I was arrested in Kennebunkport, Maine, in 1976 for driving under the influence of alcohol. I pled guilty, paid a fine, and had my driver's license suspended for 30 days. My Texas driving record has been 'lost' and is not available.   MILITARY:I joined the Texas Air National Guard and went AWOL. I refused to take a drug test or answer any questions about my drug use. By joining the Texas Air National Guard, I was able to avoid combat duty in Vietnam.   COLLEGE:I graduated from Yale University with a low C average. I was a cheerleader.   PAST WORK EXPERIENCE:I ran for U.S. Congress and lost. I began my career in the oil business in Midland, Texas, in 1975. I bought an oil company, but couldn't find any oil in Texas. I bought the Texas Rangers baseball team in a sweetheart deal that took land using taxpayer money. With the help of my father and our right-wing friends in the oil industry (including Enron CEO Ken Lay), I was elected governor of Texas.   ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS GOVERNOR OF TEXAS:I changed Texas pollution laws to favor power and oil companies, making Texas the most polluted state in the Union. During my tenure, Houston replaced Los Angeles as the most smog-ridden city in America. I cut taxes and bankrupted the Texas treasury to the tune of billions in borrowed money. I set the record for the most executions by any governor in American history. With the help of my brother, the governor of Florida, and my father's appointments to the SupremeCourt, I became President after losing by over 500,000 votes.   ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS PRESIDENT:I am the first President in U.S. history to enter office with acriminal record.&nbsp; I invaded and occupied two countries at a continuing cost of over one billion dollars per week.   ECONOMY:I spent the U.S. surplus and effectively bankrupted the U.S. Treasury. I shattered the record for the largest annual deficit in U.S. history. I set an economic record for most private bankruptcies filed in any 12-month period. I set the all-time record for most foreclosures in a 12-month period. I set the all-time record for the biggest drop in the history of the U.S. stock market.In my first year in office, over 2 million Americans lost their jobs and that trend has continued for the majority of my time in office.   CABINET: I'm proud that the members of my cabinet are the richest of any administration in U.S. history. My 'poorest millionaire,' Condoleeza Rice, has a Chevron oil tanker named after her. I set the record for most campaign fund-raising trips by a U.S. President. I am the all-time U.S. and world record-holder for receiving the most corporate campaign donations.   PRIVILEGE: My largest lifetime campaign contributor, and one of mybest friends, Kenneth Lay, presided over the largest corporate bankruptcy fraud in U.S. history, Enron. My political party used Enron private jets and corporate attorneys to assure my success with the U.S. Supreme Court during my election decision. I have protected myfriends at Enron and Halliburton against investigation or prosecution. More time and money was spent investigating the Monica Lewinsky affair than has been spent investigating one of the biggest corporate rip-offs in history.   CORRUPTION:I presided over the biggest energy crisis in U.S. historyand refused to intervene when corruption involving the oil industry was revealed.&nbsp; I presided over the highest gasoline prices in U.S. history. I changed the U.S. policy to allow convicted criminals to be awarded government contracts. I appointed more convicted criminals to administration than any President in U.S. history.   FOREIGN RELATIONS: I created the Ministry of Homeland Security, the largest bureaucracy in the history of the United States government. I've broken more international treaties than any President in U.S. history.&nbsp; I am the first President in U.S. history to have the United Nations remove the U.S. from the Human Rights Commission. I withdrew the U.S. from the World Court of Law. I refused to allow inspectors access to U.S. 'prisoners of war' detainees and thereby have refused to abide by the Geneva Convention. I am the first President in history to refuse United Nations election inspectors (during the 2002 U.S. election).   ACCESS:I set the record for fewest number of press conferences of any President since the advent of television. I set the all-time record for most days on vacation in any one-year period. After taking off the entire month of August, I resided over the worst security failure in U.S. history.   WORLD IMAGE: I garnered the most sympathy for the U.S. after the World Trade Center attacks and less than a year later made the U.S. the most hated country in the world, the largest failure of diplomacy in world history. I have set the all-time record for most people worldwideto simultaneously protest me in public venues (15 million people), shattering the record for protest against any person in the history of mankind. I am the first President in U.S. history to order an unprovoked, pre-emptive attack and the military occupation of a sovereign nation. I did so against the will of the United Nations, the majority of U.S. citizens, and the world community. I have cut health care benefits for war veterans and support a cut in duty benefits foractive duty troops and their families -- in wartime.   MILITARY INTELLIGENCE: In my State of the Union Address, I lied about our reasons for attacking Iraq, then blamed the lies on our British friends. I am the first President in history to have a majority of Europeans (71%) view my presidency as the biggest threat to world peace and security. I am supporting development of a nuclear 'Tactical Bunker Buster,' a WMD. I have so far failedto fulfill my pledge to bring Osama Bin Laden to justice.   RECORDS AND REFERENCES:  All records of my tenure as governor of Texas are now in my father's library, sealed and unavailable for public view.

"8762",8762,734562,"Libra","           John --  Given that if I die her options in life greatly diminish -- and given that others with similar conditions do not have access to the benefits that I can provide, albeit with difficulty -- I will opt for affordable.  That said, I don't consider the two goals (affordability and high quality) necessarily to be mutually exclusive -- but that, as with most things, is a matter of individual conclusions drawn from the available data.  And yes, I do indeed subscribe to a number of absolutes -- while accepting that acting on those absolutes is not entirely effective in all cases, despite the times when I do anyway.  They're also subject not only to change, but to wide variation based on past and future conditions.  I try to adapt and accept that any given conclusion I form may be wrong, but I don't often succeed.  The curse of consciousness:  the only universe I will ever truly know is the one I perceive, physically, mentally, emotionally, or spiritually.  If anything is a recipe for godhood, that's it.  Fraught with unseen dangers, human consciousness is.  That said, I wish there was a Republican I could vote for.  But conservative ideology has replaced judgment; guiding principles have become a careening, unthinking thrillride.  I'd say the same of a Democrat if such was the case; but so far, Kerry has not alarmed me.  Perhaps he will.  To be fair, very likely he will.  We left the altruistic politician (of any ideology) far behind some 200+ years ago (if he or she ever existed at all).  Until either party stops trying to stir its base into a frothy frenzy, the only option available to me is to do my part to keep the pendulum from swinging too far either way.  This administration has swung it too far, too fast.  Any party could have done it.  The pendulum's arc needs to be tempered.  Lacking a leader I can trust, I will opt for tempering until something better comes along.         "

I'm not asking why you hate George Bush, but why should I consider voting for Kerry?  I have not seen many people excited about voting for him.  I have seen plenty of people seething with hatred toward a man who has led us through a recession, terrorist attack, and massive corporate scandals, to the point that the Federal Reserve had to raise interest rates to 'cool down the economy' (on a side note, I never have understood that reasoning).  I know plenty of people who hate him because he says what he believes and he does (or trys to do) what he says.  I asked Ben that question and got the very honest answer that he really wasn't voting for Kerry but against Bush.  I am probably in the same boat, on the opposite side.  I am a conservative.  I am for small government.  I believe that people are the answer to problems, not government.  I am probably more Libertarian than Republican, but until the Libertarians get off the 'legalize pot' argument as their primary campaign issue, I'll have to settle for the Republicans.  Don't misuderstand me, I think pot should be legalized and regualted, but they make a major PR gaff by making that their primary issue.  George Bush has disappointed me in many ways.  He has introduced some radically liberal, big government, social programs that I disagree with.  But, he has many more of my values than John Kerry.  In fact, I think that I only share one value with John Kerry - we both like living/breathing (as versus being dead).  Add to that the fact the he will not make a stand on an issue (i.e. waffling back and forth), then I have no respect for him at all.  I also like the hypocrisy of the talk of the 'Two Americas', considering his wealth and his running mates wealth.             "

According to one source in Pakistan's powerful Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI),  'The Pakistani government is really desperate and wants to flush out bin Laden and his associates after the latest pressures from the U.S. administration to deliver before the [upcoming] U.S. elections.'  Introducing target dates for Al Qaeda captures is a new twist in U.S.-Pakistani counterterrorism relations - according to a recently departed intelligence official, 'no timetable[s]' were discussed in 2002 or 2003 - but the November election is apparently bringing a new deadline pressure to the hunt.   Another official, this one from the Pakistani Interior Ministry, which is responsible for internal security, explains,  'The Musharraf government has a history of rescuing the Bush administration. They now want Musharraf to bail them out when they are facing hard times in the coming elections.'  (These sources insisted on remaining anonymous. Under Pakistan's Official Secrets Act, an official leaking information to the press can be imprisoned for up to ten years.)   A third source, an official who works under ISI's director, Lieutenant General Ehsan ul-Haq, informed tnr that the Pakistanis  'have been told at every level that apprehension or killing of HVTs before [the] election is [an] absolute must.'  What's more, this source claims that Bush administration officials have told their Pakistani counterparts they have a date in mind for announcing this achievement:  'The last ten days of July deadline has been given repeatedly by visitors to Islamabad and during [ul-Haq's] meetings in Washington.'  Says McCormack: 'I'm aware of no such comment.' But according to this ISI official, a White House aide told ul-Haq last spring that  'it would be best if the arrest or killing of [any] HVT were announced on twenty-six, twenty-seven, or twenty-eight July' - the first three days of the Democratic National Convention in Boston.    read the rest of the article  urlLink here .    concerning reports of Iraqi children being held in U.S. detention centers:   'According to information from the International Red Cross,  more than a 100 children are imprisoned in Iraq, including in the infamous prison Abu Ghraib.
